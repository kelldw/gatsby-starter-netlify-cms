  tactics and routines that help them get there now it's your journey so it's
  time to learn what's going to get you there what got you there with Sean
  Delaney what got you there with sounded lady what got you there with Sean the
  lady I think as a society we want more variety we want more choice we want
  more weirdness we don't want to live in a world where there's four or five
  large tech companies it'd be great to live in the world where there's a
  thousand small tech companies and I think in order to create that we need to
  literally create and generate more founders and I don't think it's that the
  world is lacking in sufficient IQ or people that would be smart enough or
  people that would be gritty enough I think it's that the world is lacking in a
  way to kind of radicalize people to pursue their passions Daniel Gross is the
  founder of Pioneer a fully remote accelerator that backs brilliant founders
  from all over the world pioneer is changing the way that companies are formed
  and pioneer has already backed more than 100 founders Daniel's origin story
  begins in Israel and when he was 18 he was accepted into Y Combinator being
  the youngest founder ever at that time he founded a company called Q an AI
  powered search engine that was acquired by Apple when he was just 22 Daniel
  was a previous guest on episode number 124 and if you haven't heard it go
  ahead and check that out so on this episode Sean and Daniel discuss a wide
  range of topics from Daniel's decision making process his recent marathon in
  Antarctica what he's seen most in the most successful entrepreneurs and so

  your order Daniel so it's been about a year since we last talked and we're
  gonna get into tech startups and what the world 2.0 looks like after k√∂ppen 19
  but I have to hear about the marathon you recently ran in Antarctica how is
  that I wouldn't know what that experience was like sure it thanks again for
  having me on I'm delighted to talk I recently finished running yeah a bunch of
  miles marathon in Antarctica in all honesty most of the credit in will fame or
  infamy it goes to go to my friend Kyle fo who who I was pacing Kyle was
  running seven marathons and seven continents and trying to set the record for
  doing it in 77 hours he ended up completing the feat in about I think 84 or 85
  hours still shattering the record by quite some bit and I paced him for a few
  of those marathons certainly not all of them but the first one that we ran was
  in Antarctica very interesting place quite desolate I think the best way to
  envision it is if you have ever been in a desert you can kind of imagine that
  just with with the you know with with the conditions you'd expect much colder
  snow wind we think Faline ice visibility actually there was a marathon that
  was around about 48 hours prior to us and we were kind of looking at finishing
  times there and fastest finishing times four hours and change and you know for
  a marathon usually it's just slightly under half of that you know you know two
  hours 20 minutes for a speedy finish so if the you know top finishers
  finishing at 4 hours that means conditions are really bad so we were kind of
  getting worried ourselves figured we power through regardless but we had a
  little bit of wind but it was pretty nice regardless packed snow you know you
  kind of think of this surface being like a kind of a beach a style and in
  terms of the impact you get from it and so that means that it's actually a
  little bit easier on your knees but you have to apply a little bit more force
  because you're getting less force back from the ground you're sinking a little
  bit in each step so it takes out you know surprising amount of you but it's
  just a thrilling place to be and and you know running I find has this
  interesting effect where it really encodes things into memory you know I find
  if I'm on vacation and then go run I really remember the area that I ran in
  and the sort of salt day even though we ran kind of laps around the airfield
  that we landed in I remember it intently intensely he's running an environment
  much different do your senses or are they impacted differently then than just
  a normal run call it out in San Francisco well I mean certainly in it's much
  colder and and so you know I think if an East Coast run it would probably be
  pretty familiar with just running in the snow and the cold so you know certain
  parts of you get get numb I mean surprisingly your chest and torso warm up as
  long as you keep on moving but you know you you gotta have good gloves to keep
  the the fingers warm and you know we wore Deborah double-layer socks just to
  just to keep the extremities warm the actual you know aspect of running is not
  that different we for all of the marathons we ended up running you know either
  out in backs or laps near the airport and so you know you were you were kind
  of just you know keeping track of the mileage that we're doing but other than
  that you know it wasn't too distinct it's a sea level so you know the amount
  of oxygen you have is as great we were just trying to make sure that you know
  we didn't go out too strong Kyle had another six marathons after Antarctica
  and so we were you know trying to keep a moderate pace but you know other than
  that the the only way you'd know you you were in Antarctica I think is is well
  just by the infinite horizon of snow and again we caught it on a good day I
  mething third days where there's um you could you can really experience the
  full scope of nature's wrath in Antarctica and it's you know as I understand
  the conditions can get quite tough but but for us on a beautiful day was it
  was like a windy snowed in day maybe on the East Coast how'd that opportunity
  even come to you I've known Kyle for quite some time as an investor and his
  company is called cruise got acquired by General Motors for about a billion
  dollars that building self-driving cars and indeed maybe one of the first to
  market and I've known him for quite some time prior to that while he was
  running his earlier company which would turn into justin.tv which would turn
  it of course into switch into twitch and we've kind of been old friends and I
  think he knows I'm up for adventures in particular running adventures and so
  at some point around Christmas he told me he was gonna do this and you know
  it's I find it kind of interesting I don't know why I said yes but it was very
  clear to me that I had to do it once the opportunity was available yeah that's
  what I'm curious about those adventures you're going after and I'm even
  intrigued do you learn new things about yourself after taking on something
  like that um yeah I mean I enjoy finding me and I don't think I'm alone I
  think a lot of people enjoy fine you know finding the limits of my body and my
  mind you know it's I think you learn maybe a little bit less you know
  something specific about yourself and more I think you just gain confidence
  knowing that you know you did that really hard thing and so whatever you're
  staring at you can probably you know get over and III that's why I started
  running in the first place yeah I'm wondering even how you I know for me
  internally when I take on one of those challenges it's almost like a new bar
  has been raised and set we're now that confidence that I was able to tackle
  that you can go on to to more intense challenging things so I'm wondering
  finding the limits for you when you think about that that phrase what comes to
  mind both internally in terms of difficulty with your mind and then also
  physical challenges well I mean I for me I'll be honest with you you know I'm
  um I'm the by no means perfect in this regard I also am very close to and
  mostly do this this sport that happened to love which is running and you know
  and and as you know once you kind of get into running it's it's not as hard as
  it seems but it's it does seem to the outside are very crazy I think when you
  tell them even though I just you know I ran it's 13 or 14 miles today um you
  know to the to an outsider that seems very crazy and and hard but you know for
  me it's it's it's not easy but it's a thrill and it's certainly something I
  enjoy so you know I I'm not as good as others about constantly kind of
  stretching and driving different sports although I am interested in it running
  for me has also very nice efficiency to it there's only so much you can do of
  it it's it's it's quite um you know it takes quite a toll on your body you
  could go out and you could bike ride for five hours and be fine you you can't
  really run for five hours I mean you can but you know you're not gonna be able
  to work afterwards or run the next day so for me it's very nice in the sense
  that it's very you know it's very efficient um you know I'm gonna go running
  at some point later today and you know it'll be about 50 minutes of my time
  but it'll yield dividends greater than 50 minutes in terms of my productivity
  for the rest of the day and and it still kind of stresses my body there I
  don't think there's actually a better way probably just in in just in terms of
  minutes and and maybe overall longevity benefits I don't think there's
  something much better than running but but that being said you know I I enjoy
  within within that sport I enjoy trying to find the limits you know either
  trying to get faster or trying just you know a distance I haven't tried are
  kind of like the novelty of it and and and and I think it's quite I mean for
  me it's very helpful to have something other than work that's kind of a game I
  can work on something I could thinking about and something I can win and maybe
  lose it but it's it's very helpful you know you work has its ups and downs not
  all of which I could control and it's quite nice to you know even during a day
  that you know might be quite intense from a work perspective have that have it
  just another different thing to work on I think other people have you know
  other forms of these outlets you know one day if I'm lucky enough maybe I'll
  have children maybe that will become that and or you know sometimes I go play
  video games I kind of get it it's nice to be able to escape almost to a
  different universe and so that's that's really maybe another thing that I get
  out of it but you know I I look I love challenge adventure and and I think if
  I if I had a little bit more more free time I would think about more creative
  things to do Kyle was very inspiring to me in that regard I mean here's a
  fairly busy individual running a very large unit within a very large company
  working on one of the most important software hardware projects of the 21st
  century arguably and yet you know he thought of this he made the time and he
  actually did it um very very much kind of you know made me think gosh you know
  I I'd love to do some style of particular adventure like that in the future
  you know something at the intersection of running logistics software I should
  say Kyle were actually wrote an open sourced actual software he had to write
  to do this because you know you have the traditional quite famous software
  problem called the Traveling Salesman problem when you ask yourself the
  question you know if I want to run in seven continents in the shortest period
  of time you know given everything you know about you know airports and flights
  what is the most efficient way to do that and software actually answer that
  question and so it's a very very cool project truly at the intersection of
  that man's interests and yeah maybe one day I'll grow up and I'll do something
  similar do you have anything in mind in terms of what you'd like to tackle
  there well you know hopefully at some point in in the Farfetch'd feature when
  there was a vaccine and this thing is behind us I do think traveling to kind
  of interesting new desolate places is is very interesting you know so much of
  our memory as humans is spatial we remember things based on place I certainly
  I'm experiencing now I don't know if you are but you know now that we're all
  kind of in lockdown and we're not moving around although the day-to-day of my
  life hasn't changed that much in terms of what I do I find that remember much
  less of it just because it's all blurry um you know I think it turned out that
  afternoon coffee you were getting half of the value was a cup of coffee half
  of it was just going to another place and breaking up the day a little bit and
  so that's kind of making me even forgot shouldn't be it'd be great to do some
  type of travel to you know really remote places where you're constantly
  changing locations all the time I look I've I've stared down at a lot of weird
  records and again it's so funny I don't even understand why I would go do it
  you know I'm everything from longest time someone's you know ran on a
  treadmill to you know the longest set of contiguous marathons to all sorts of
  weird stuff and yeah it's it's it's we were kind of kidding to ourselves as we
  were running the second marathon which was in Argentina that we don't we
  didn't even really know why we were doing that you know at a deep level just
  felt like it had to happen so I don't know anything specific yet but but I am
  excited by the thrill of it I think it'd be really interesting to traverse
  more of Antarctica I think that that continent not only is it the only
  continent without coronavirus but it's I mean it's very underrated and it's a
  very interesting place there are fractions of Antarctica that are unclaimed by
  any other nation and yet larger than you know California State and so that's
  that's a pretty fascinating thing when you think about it I mean there's land
  that is larger than countries that no one's really claiming and you know the
  the the eye of the of the world is really towards you know Mars maybe
  rightfully so it's very interesting but here right right here on earth we a
  lot of undiscovered stuff you know the other thing that I'm super fascinated
  by is the ocean just the underwater life super undiscovered and there are all
  sorts of interesting treasures underwater that we used to have a culture of
  going after you know people looking for sunken booty and ships and you know
  that all kind of faded at some point but you know there's a lot of interesting
  stuff there Jeff besos plucked out of the water Apollo 11s original saturn v
  engine and that now sits somewhere in his one of his homes I mean that's
  incredible what a piece of art to have and there's plenty more of that
  interesting stuff you know at the bottom of the ocean we don't really know how
  to traverse it but that's another form of management that I think would be
  incredibly interesting to to go and explore yeah interesting people doing
  interesting things and you're certainly at the intersection of that and you're
  bringing up some of these things that that you're intrigued by that your
  curiosity is being piqued with what are those moments like when your curiosity
  is piqued when you talk about underwater discoveries and things like that what
  our next steps for you when you get intrigued by something yeah it's funny I
  I'm smiling because I think the broader topic of motivation what pulls one in
  different directions is very interesting and it's something I well I mean
  collectively the whole team at pioneer spent a huge amount of time thinking on
  because let's imagine we could crack this let's imagine I could tell you I
  kind of know I've we've reverse engineered motivation and here's like a script
  we can write where we can kind of motivate anyone to do anything boy I mean
  that would be incredible we could fix so much of the world problems I think we
  could create many more startups as a result like my dream for pioneer isn't it
  for it to be a startup accelerator it is for it to be a start-up a generator
  to create more companies that wouldn't have been possible before and I think
  the way we would go about doing that is we would kind of buy into the
  assumption that there are thousands of amazing companies you know your next
  stripe Facebook Pinterest snapchat whatever that are you know github repos
  with tenkan Mithen where the person then gave up because they lost motivation
  and and and I understand it and I think everyone can understand this right you
  working on anything there's a kind of an ebb and flow to it and I feel like
  the world broadly speaking all the jobs in the world could be separated into
  maybe one of two buckets the first we could kind of think of as you know clear
  we could kind of call them clear jobs where it's very clear what to do next so
  this would be anything from working in the military to working at Starbucks
  it's very clear how to advance in the career it's very clear what the next
  mission is it's very clear with the you know the next thing to do working on a
  large company is the same you have a boss the boss gives you work you do the
  work the boss gives you a is great but then there are opaque jobs and opaque
  jobs unlike clear jobs it's not clear what to do next it's not really clear
  where the motivation should come from it's not really clear what success would
  look like you know we can kind of think of an opaque job as the job of someone
  working as an early-stage founder I actually think investors are somewhat
  similar um it's not always clear what to invest in what to do and in an opaque
  job and you know I feel like there are a lot of casualties of motivation where
  yet you kind of are working on something and because there's no external
  validation you just stop doing it for you know at some point and so motivation
  comes in these you know fits and starts and and and it's very unclear to
  anyone really what what drives it what causes it in and the role of pioneer is
  at least for the world of kind of early-stage startup and company building to
  try to take people that have otherwise would have given up and to propel them
  into this treadmill of productivity to get them going and and to get them to
  work on it a little bit more harder you know for every time you know when I
  was 18 years old for every time I thought of applying to Y Combinator or
  trying to you know email someone at Sequoia for money there maybe 20 times
  where I just kind of self edited out of that well you know doesn't seem like a
  real thing why bother and move on and then at some point I kind of did it and
  you know to our earlier conversation I expense a lot of parallels here with
  running where I didn't take running seriously for a very long time and then I
  accidentally signed up for a marathon I don't know maybe a half a decade or
  longer ago and then I accidentally told people I signed up for a marathon and
  one thing leads to the next and suddenly I'm running intervals in a track so
  you know there are all these ways to kind of propel yourself or force yourself
  to do things and we want to instrument that in software in what Pioneer does
  and so we have this whole mechanic around you know a leaderboard and points
  and all that gamification is really in service of getting people to go the
  extra mile for themselves really it's very much how like the the whole peloton
  platform you know the bike the treadmill they have gets people to workout a
  little bit more and and so you know for me the whole ah you know story around
  curiosity and motivation it really is the dissecting that and solving that and
  breaking that apart is is I think the key to creating kind of more startups in
  the world which I should mention is something we want like I think as a
  society we want more variety we want more choice we want more weirdness we
  don't want to live in a world where there's four or five large tech companies
  it would be great to live in the world where there's a thousand small tech
  companies and I think in order to create that we need to literally create and
  generate more founders and I don't think it's that the world is lacking
  sufficient IQ or people that would be smart enough or people that would be
  gritty enough I think it's that the world is lacking in a way to kind of for
  addict allows people to pursue their passions and that's the purpose of
  Pioneer yeah that's just such an interesting hypothesis it makes me even think
  back I grew up playing sports so I had a sports background I don't even just
  think about some of those little motivations those little nudges that a
  certain coach maybe gave me at one of those inflection points and that little
  bit of motivation just helped me go so much further along my own progress and
  and you're talking about doing this in terms of companies and founders and and
  you're assessing hundreds of not thousands of founders per year and I'm
  wondering do you believe that you really can dissect what motivates them and
  what-what that curiosity looks like it's interesting because I think you kind
  of answer the question with your earlier point so you know when the coach when
  when when you're running or doing any sport and in if you have the right
  psychology of kind of you know kind of an insecure overachiever what's gonna
  happen is you are going to be your largest critic and your largest kind of
  enemy the voice inside your head you know that says this wasn't good enough
  you know I bet this was bad you should try harder and and so you tend to push
  yourself you know to two extremes pretty quickly and it's just when you were
  kind of gonna give up on the whole thing because why bother and maybe you know
  you know everything you do is just not great enough where the coach says that
  was a great set and that really changes things inside you and we see this kind
  of on the internet if I'm very tickled by it you know someone will get just a
  like on Twitter or Facebook from someone they admire and that will change them
  for the day maybe the week and so you know I think as humans I think it's
  actually fairly healthy that we look for a sense of accomplishment from other
  humans I mean if we didn't have that we would all off be doing crazy things
  maybe bad things I think in many ways that's that's kind of what morality is
  the sense that if I did this other humans would perceive it badly so I
  shouldn't do that and that kind of makes sense that at a global scale now like
  everything taken to an extreme I think it's bad you know you don't want to be
  entirely driven by what other people think because I think then then you get
  stuck in the cycle of conventionalism but having the you know the right people
  be ones that you kind of you perform for and you admire I think is it's both
  you know true and important and so what I think we can do is I think we can
  and try to engineer mechanics where you know one of two things happens either
  you get a sense of approval from like say a coach that what you're doing is
  great and you should move on and you should take that a little bit more
  seriously and you know and that for us can be the you know pioneer is an
  opaque thing could be one of our experts and then of course the other thing is
  just this this element of the other thing that's very pleasant in sports is
  you know kind of when you're playing and you where you rank and you're kind of
  not winning all the time nor are you losing all the time and you get a sense
  of how you're improving and that's one of them in one of the ways where I
  think you know pioneers kind of leaderboard mechanic is quite effective you
  you constantly get a sense kind of of where you are and how you're improving
  and some people love competing against others other people really love just
  competing against themselves and just you know everyone wants to kind of get
  better every day and so I think with its kind of two mechanics you know nudges
  from kind of coaches to your point as well as a constant sense of improvement
  we can you know get people to trip into building their their kind of next
  great thing and let's not forget this is not to a far-fetched of a claim
  because if we look a little bit closer at the earlier versions of say Facebook
  where you can have you can watch interviews with Mark Zuckerberg from 2005
  where you know he very much decries the platform ever-growing beyond you know
  Harvard just a small Harvard photo directory or I mean in all honesty even
  Elon Musk where you know SpaceX was set up as basically a giant photo op on on
  Mars that was the plan let's buy some Russian rockets launched a bunch of then
  on to Mars get it to take a photo of what life is like on Mars and then shut
  down the company you know lo and behold Facebook of course turns into the
  largest not even social network but maybe you know um you kind of kind of
  human directory service in the world and SpaceX is the largest private space
  company you know far more successful than many nation-states they were not
  started in that way they were started as fairly dumb simple projects and
  things really evolved over time so so so if you if you inspect closely that
  and I and I get a lot of joy by looking at early versions of you know Facebook
  or Amazon or Google by the way Google University project called backrub for
  chrissake you you you're kind of reminded that everything big start small and
  that is I think really important to remember because if you if you if you
  believe that then I think you automatically believe that more small things
  could could become big you bring up another really interesting thread about
  how some of these gigantic organizations have started small with a simple idea
  and I know you've kind of seen behind closed doors of some of the world's
  leaders in terms of technology and I would love to know what it's like behind
  those doors are they just like everyone else because I think young
  entrepreneurs are people interested in starting a company they look up to a
  Bezos and and they think he's just operating at such a different level and and
  that might be a bad example because he might be but I'm wondering the majority
  of people are are there enough people who can emulate them to some degree with
  enough time and experience yeah I mean for me I I grew up adoring apple just
  adoring it I didn't have all the Apple products but I certainly knew about
  every single one of them and I was very much I thought myself a disciple of
  Steve Jobs you know watching there was a YouTube channel I think it shut down
  called every Steve Jobs video and this is back in the day where you could like
  watch the entirety of YouTube but I think I watched every video on every Steve
  Jobs video and you never properly met the man my only runnin with him was a
  literal run and where he almost ran me over once but when once we got acquired
  by Apple Steve was had unfortunately already passed but I was very curious to
  meet the rest of the leadership of at the time the world's largest company and
  and really get a sense for you know for what these inhuman gods were like and
  of course you go and you meet folks and you know I don't know if you've ever
  had the experience is like meeting rock stars or people you grew up admiring
  but you meet them and you constantly have the same reflection which is gosh no
  human they're human just like me and you know I don't mean to demean them
  they're much smarter than me and you know there is a real intelligence to some
  of apples leadership is the main thing I can I can speak about at large you
  know fortune 50 list having spent a lot of time with those guys I mean every
  Apple leader themselves could could and is running actually a fortune 50
  company in terms of revenue they're very smart but they're very human too and
  you know they have their you know their eccentric disease and their flaws and
  it's a real reminder that that you know you're not that different from them
  for me one of the biggest moments in in my life where I kind of realized I
  could do it is I remember when I came out here Mark Zuckerberg came to give a
  talk and in all honesty you know at the time Facebook was you know weirdly
  even more hype than it is now it was kind of before it was it was on that's
  ascendancy in the s-curve but just seeing him talk and and seeing him it you
  know in the flash made me realize well you know he's human I'm human so I'm
  sure I can figure something out and you know maybe it won't become Facebook
  but it'll be something and I think that's the thing for people to realize is
  you see all of these people through screens and you see them in their fully
  manicured form you know don't forget when you watch someone like even Mark
  Zuckerberg or even Elon you know both who are you know certainly know
  churchill's in terms of they're all raishin ability these are people that have
  gone through hours of media training hours of staring at themselves on video
  and just trying to figure out how to perfect how to improve and you know maybe
  they don't give a damn but certainly they have media teams just working on
  polishing the image over and over and over and and they're meant to project
  force power and pride it's it's obviously in their best interest to do that
  given where they are but you know but behind that is someone who you know is
  very similar if not identical to any kind of early stage founder so look there
  is something something smart unique oh wow Siri just turned out on my computer
  sorry about that um there are something smart and unique about those people
  but you know I don't think it's a a million thing I think it's a one in a
  thousand thing I'm someone interested how you view that now when you have
  young entrepreneurs young founders come up to you who are viewing you in that
  light as well I mean here you came from another country got acquired for tens
  of millions are building some incredible things out there in the world so how
  do you think about that now since you're still so close to that when you have
  young people reach out to you yep you know III try to make my set up my time
  in the kind of this barbell approach forum but you know very interested in
  meeting on people that have been underrated by the world you know Outsiders
  people that dumb you know feel like they they they don't belong wherever they
  are but they also aren't you know quite you know at at their peak moment of
  Fame here in Silicon Valley you know knew the other extreme I try to spend a
  lot of time with kind of existing close friends and you know it's important
  for me to you know to communicate you know to everyone that I meet that's kind
  of just getting started that you know that they can do it I mean it's the
  that's the biggest message I try to deliver to people it's very interesting to
  think though and to wonder you know at the end of the day a lot of people ask
  me the following question you know when they reach out is like what you so
  what will I learn by coming out to say Silicon Valley that I you know that I
  can't learn online or what is it at the end of the day that you know investors
  or places like Y Combinator are teaching people and and you know the the funny
  thing is a lot of people think you know they're gonna they're gonna be
  learning if like us like some secret rule um you know in formula that's really
  kept here like that you know it's like the coke formula or something um the
  reality that is and the thing I try to convey people to people when I meet
  them is that the main thing of Silicon Valley like the big idea here you that
  in certain properties in the world to the internet being one of those worlds
  you can grow much faster than you anticipate that is the big thing people
  don't realize you know they're they're sending ten emails a week not a hundred
  thousand emails a week they're trying to grow revenue a thousand dollars a
  month not a million dollars a month and and people kind of forget the math of
  CagA of the compounding annual growth rate or weekly growth rate you know 5%
  week over week starts to add up really quickly I highly would encourage
  everyone I mean I you know I guess now with coronavirus we're a little bit
  more aware of what 33% every week means but you can open a spreadsheet and you
  can just do the math of 5% week over week and put in any number that you care
  about the number of users you have the number of revenue you're chasing and
  and things start stacking in this weird way where it's as again it's very kind
  of non-intuitive to the human mind and it's really teaching that to people
  it's teaching to people that you can get big and you can grow big that I think
  is the main lesson of Silicon Valley you can kind of think of here's a fun
  analogy like the world basically has all of these computers that could do
  amazing things but they've all been under clocked by the manufacturer and and
  what Silicon Valley really tries to do is I don't know if it's overclocking or
  getting them to the correct clock speed but it is certainly increasing the the
  kind of strength and the speed of the processor itself in people when did you
  learn that lesson was it after coming to Silicon Valley or were you aware of
  that before no I wasn't I mean I grew up in Israel and I would read articles
  about tak Ranch about Silicon Valley and it seemed to me as as as as foreign
  as middle-earth I mean it's obviously a place maybe fictional amazing things
  happening there you know Elrond and Gandalf walking around but certainly not a
  place I can access and then I came out here and then I suddenly know I was
  here and I remember I just you know all these companies some of them would go
  under over time but I you know was walking around kind of the the bay area and
  I see the offices of you know Foursquare and Gowalla you know the time
  location-based social networks were all the hype this 2009 2010 and I'm a la I
  felt like I was on a movie set and uh and I had no idea I think I had no idea
  that things get big but then you know you meet people you have friends and
  then what happens is your friends occasionally some of them and their
  companies you know start to do really well and they start grossing millions of
  dollars in revenue and you're looking around and you're staring at your hands
  and you're staring at their hands and then you're staring at your hands and
  you're saying well we both have ten fingers so obviously I could be doing more
  and so there's this interesting positive form of competition where it's not
  I'm trying to eat away at their successes their success is motivating me to
  realize I can do much more so again so like humans aren't born with the sense
  that they can start a company that turns into Amazon and you know what
  statistically the odds are that it won't happen but when it does happen to
  someone it'll it'll be started by the same person as you that's the person
  listening to this and that's a super important lesson and I didn't I mean I
  certainly didn't know that in it and it took me you know quite some time to
  internalize but it's funny now that I have that I find I find there's a
  certain element of confidence in it that you know that I know that I I'll
  figure it out and I'll get there and it's very similar going back to how we
  open the conversation for me I found it very helpful you know many years ago
  to finish a marathon my first marathon because I knew I could do that and that
  you know that makes running two miles seem like a joke so yeah I mean I don't
  think you're born with this some people are born with this knowledge Churchill
  famously was basically you know from birth thought he was there to save the
  world but most of us aren't born with it and it's something you discover over
  time yet Daniel one of the things I appreciate most about you especially
  during our conversations is just your ability to synthesize your ideas and
  your thinking it's just just a clear and concise and I mean that's just an
  excellent framework for someone who doesn't have this experience and I'm just
  wondering some of the other main frameworks and models that you found most
  helpful overall yeah it's funny I can't I get a lot of the kind of mental
  model questions uh you know I I don't have them I'm a bit more of an of a jazz
  improviser a bad one probably then a classical musician you know I don't have
  like a particular scripture I subscribed to I do think there are there are a
  bunch of you know mental kind of tricks or fallacies that people fall into
  there's plenty to be right about this online you know I think famously Charlie
  Munger has this book poor Charlie's Almanac which discusses this in quite
  length and if you don't want to read the book or buy it it's actually an
  expensive book oddly it's great summaries of it online but one that's been
  very topical for me of late with it with coronavirus is just the law of
  exponents and exponential growth you know doubling every week again it's it's
  super easy to talk about these numbers but it they're real brain Buster's
  doubling every week seems very fine until you go from a thousand to 2,000 to
  4,000 to 8,000 to 16,000 to 32,000 and and that that is it's funny you ask for
  mental frameworks I use but that's like a mental framework no one can really
  grasp their head around one of the reasons why I actually think the bay area
  was a little bit more better prepare to the coronavirus than anywhere else is
  staring an exponential growth and dreaming of exponential growth in good forms
  is something we do all day and so we were quite aware of you know well it
  might be going from four to eight deaths but if it's doubling every week you
  know I think we were quite aware of how bad it could get because the those
  charts that those the shape of those charts is very familiar to us but I think
  most people don't understand that most people don't understand the math of
  compounding I think that it's like a that's another weird secret you know it's
  it's it's you can they take ya for whatever for wherever you want to be in
  terms of revenue you have how much money you have how many users you have you
  could take wherever you know whatever number that is and plug it into a
  spreadsheet and just set 5% growth as your target weekly and it starts out
  really easy and but if you manage to keep the pace you get to large numbers
  very quickly so it's another thing to flag for people and you were you were
  mentioning you're more like a jazz musician I'm wondering have you read the
  book effortless effortless mastery I've leased through it I wouldn't call it a
  red one but yeah I own it okay yeah no just talking about the the
  improvisation and and how you go about things it just seems similar to that
  framework so I just wandering him you would head check that out at all you did
  bring up an interesting thing though and and understanding the limits of your
  knowledge and what you're not capable of so are there certain things over the
  past year with with pioneer you guys have come across and we can call them
  just blind spots and I'm wondering if you've changed anything even at the
  margin and what that process has looked like for you yes constantly adjusting
  and learning you know I think the I think it's fairly well I think it's
  impossible for a mortal to build a product and have it be successful with
  literally no edits you know kind of headshot situation I think it's very
  possible for someone to build something that is directionally good and try to
  get feedback from customers the only amount of goodness you need in your
  product is you need sufficient goodness so that people would use it so that
  they will give you feedback that is it and so thankfully we have that with
  Pioneer and so we get copious amounts of feedback and you know one one
  particular thing you know that that we improved on recently is you know people
  I think wanted a structured way to understand you know how they would get
  funding from Pioneer and our you know our original kind of a funding offer was
  just complicated and and one of the things I'm trying to fix in the venture
  world is negotiation which I think no founder wants because negotiating
  against a VC is I think flat-out unfair you're doing a negotiation for the
  fourth time probably in your life and they are doing it for the fourth time
  you know this week so it sucks no one wants to you don't want to run your
  first marathon against Elliott cap Jogi so you know one thing we adjusted as a
  result is we made our terms incredibly transparent clear and it's it's
  actually we're we're gonna do it do a another step of this soon but you could
  literally go to the website and and and you could see what our terms are and
  we try to pretty much we always stick to them and so like that that was a big
  thing for us just because you know for me removing confusion from the venture
  game is incredibly important the ideal situation haven't quite arrived there
  yet but of course the ideal situation is you know you can envision like a
  Windows 98 UI or the you know get money button is grayed out and then at some
  point it turns you know block and you can click it and then you just get money
  that's it that should be obviously how this works it's like so clear when you
  think of it but there shouldn't be any of this weird kind of negotiation
  talking to different people that get money button should just turn the right
  color and you press in you're done and we'll get there we're not quite there
  but that's like a big thing we've been working on another thing we're
  constantly working on is improving the elements of feedback in the tournament
  so the way Pioneer works as you play this thing and you try to get some points
  and improve kind of your score week over week and one of the things that
  drives your score is other people kind of commenting on the progress you made
  over the course of a particular week and they have the ability to leave
  feedback for you and I must say you know part of a lot of this is due to the
  you know work that um the engineering team has done notably our our star
  copilot Rishi and a lot of its I think due to maybe community lock dynamics
  but the feedback on pioneer is really good and this is a big deal because as
  you know on Sudan as communities on the internet people are rarely nice to
  each other but for some reason it works and so just kind of improving the
  quality of the feedback in terms of you know how we show who and what is
  another really important thing first because you know going back to your point
  about the coach that nudge where someone says you know hey this was really
  good or even constructive criticism you know hey have you considered X or Y is
  really important to people because I think that can really make the difference
  of you know a good week and in a bad week one so go ahead I don't know one
  thing you brought up a little while ago that I shoulda dove deeper into now
  but this is kind of circling back is you're mentioning the leader board and
  I'd love to know how you assess this through when you're talking about certain
  people don't like being up on the leader board and they prefer to compete
  against themselves so how do you balance that it's true I took we take I mean
  we can take a lot of inspiration from existing games that you know have
  multiple modes you can play in single player and play against your shelf or
  you could play in multiplayer with other people now unlike a game we have this
  interesting problem which is the reason single-player works is you can play
  against let's imagine it's you know some type of strategy game or whatever you
  can play against an AI you can play against a computer and the computer can
  simulate people there's something very beautiful in that because the computer
  will never see your in your nakedness you know you could have a totally
  abysmal game and no one will know now we don't have that like we don't have if
  we know how to write software that would act like the way founders do then
  we'd have a whole other business in front of us so we don't know how to write
  software that runs businesses quite yet and it may be some time before that
  happens and so we don't have doing single-player for us is a little bit more
  difficult but one thing we can do is you know that we're adding into our
  product is the ability to kind of see where you rank on the leaderboard
  without appearing or yourself if you like which is which gives you a sense of
  kind of where you stand but again it's you know not something you need to be
  public about the other thing I should mention there's a reason pioneer as
  mostly pseudonyms and not real names I mean at some point we need to know
  people's names because we need to know where to send the money but you can go
  through the entire experience making up a fake username no one will know who
  you are and that is in many ways to afford people the ability to really
  experiment and be themselves without having to put profile pictures everywhere
  and and and I think that again that allows you to compete against yourself
  without really worrying about the rest of the world so so you know I think
  both but I think you're right both modes exist and and and I think you know
  we're kind of working to serve both of them well now I preheat so much you
  being willing to talk about some of the things you're trying to change
  overcome and have dealt with because so many times we get to look up to people
  like you and it's almost like you were talking about have been so coached in
  what to say so it's just such a great perspective and I know we received a lot
  of questions just everyone with this uncertainty there want to know what's
  gonna change coming out of this and you did an amazing blog post which will
  have linked up about the world 2.0 and I'm wondering for you guys internally
  are you assessing things differently are there new opportunities you're
  looking at because everything's around coated well I think the right strategy
  for us is as much as my blog post actually try to be in the game of prediction
  the right strategy for pioneers to react it not to predict and so we're gonna
  follow you know engineers and and and founders you know to where other markets
  they think are interesting because you know I think once the spirit of human
  ingenuity manages to sink its teeth into a market something happens at some
  point and it's true things have shifted a little bit you know life is
  seemingly there's a little bit less activity and people building kind of next
  generation sass and a little bit more activity in people building kind of new
  social networks ways to stay connected at home that type of thing I think this
  beckons an interesting question which I tried to address in that post which
  I've been thinking about which is one like is Co vid 19 a thesis for
  investment or as a temporary and to if it's if the current way of life isn't a
  thesis or investment because it will change you know what things are permanent
  and what things are temporary just in terms of human behavior shifts and so to
  the first point I think the current lifestyle is temporary but I think the
  vaccine is very far away and so we can kind of view ourselves in social
  distancing purgatory for quite some time we're gonna be in between worlds and
  and that will be for a while you know my information on this changes daily you
  know the the time - a new vaccine trying to speak to different experts and
  understand you know is it going to be a year or five years but you know call
  me tomorrow but right now I'm sensing it'll be more like five years they don't
  all have the novel spike protein shape but you know let's not forget there are
  four other coronaviruses called the common cold that we don't have a vaccine
  for so this it's not as easy as it seems it's you know it's not like foul Chi
  is gonna dr. foutch is gonna just pull this up because Trump asked them to you
  know from from his dusty old cabinet where he's been hiding it so so in in
  this world you know what changes and what doesn't and I think the way to think
  of that is so there are things we can't do and if there's a if if not having
  them or if there's an if there's alternative to not having them then the
  behavior might permanently stick if not a new company will get created so I'll
  give you an example handshakes handshakes will go away because not doing
  handshakes is fine you know they're not a requirement for humans then it's not
  oxygen on the other side concerts won't be here for quite some time humans
  really like mass gatherings I mean look at what religions have you can go back
  thousands of years we've been doing this for quite some time it's not just a
  the invention of avicii and so as a result I think there'll be some really
  interesting software to be built around kind of mimicking that experience of
  of presence and you know the way it's gonna look is this I can tell you I mean
  this is the way this unfolds time and time again every time there's a new
  medium the first few examples of it are super superimpositions of the old
  media on the news so just like the first TV shows our cameras pointed at radio
  shows and the first mobile apps are you very much look like Web Apps you know
  and then someone builds in terms of TV shows Westworld and then someone who
  builds in terms of mobile apps uber so it takes quite some time as we go from
  kind of the world one point know to the world 2.0 to get there like the real
  technology out of it you know the first digital encyclopedias we're not
  Wikipedia it was Britannica on a CD and so I think you know we'll get things
  like online concerts over zoom but then I think there'll be some weird 2.0
  that someone will create of that education than a good another great example
  school over zoom is going to be the horseless carriage it's not and and
  there's gonna be something else I don't know exactly what it'll be you know
  some element of a game and education all merged in one or I suspect video is
  not the dominant medium audio is not video something like that I think will
  get created because the alternative is just not as good so that's kind of my
  rough framework for thinking about this but we're quite reactionary at pioneer
  you know we'll follow whatever people build and and chase chase what other
  dreams people have helped them maybe catch those dreams yeah your so your mode
  of thinking makes me think of that quote it's something along the lines of
  adapt to the present as opposed to trying to predict the future and so it
  sounds like that's what that's what you guys are working on you mentioned some
  of the things that are just catching your attention or where you think things
  may be leading to and I'd love to know how do you think work and hiring
  changes during all of this yeah I think the simplest mental model for that is
  a separation of the strong from the weak so I think what happens is if you're
  a good company that has a durable business model I think you basically eat up
  the best talent of the small companies that go under so that's one way hiring
  changes a lot of companies will go under and the best talent will concentrate
  within the better companies this will be painful but actually not totally bad
  because let's not forget you often need a recession for super talent to
  concentrate and for real great outcomes to happen so PayPal was the combined
  might of Max Levchin Peter Thiel Elon Musk David Sachs Keith er boy Roelof
  Botha others Jeremy Stoppelman who is the founder of Yelp all of these people
  would have had their own companies in a boom market but in a bear market you
  know they all concentrate together and I believe it was XCOM and kaan finiti
  that merged to create PayPal so I think we'll see stuff like that um in terms
  of hiring you know in terms of how work changes you know there's there's one
  side of the story which people tell you you know humans are gonna snap back to
  offices and it's all going to go back to normal um even prior to having a
  vaccine there's the other side of it which is people will tell you remotes now
  here forever and I think the truth will be somewhere in the middle obviously I
  think companies will have proven to themselves those that those that can will
  have proven to themselves that they can stay productive remote and so the
  opportunity to work remote I think will go from being seen as a perk to being
  seen as an alternative but um you know but I think offices there's just too
  much goodness in the real world for us to give up on that entirely do you thin
  I think in particular just one final thought a lot of that goodness is
  serendipity and we don't know how to do that on the internet yet but maybe we
  will but there's a lot there's a lot of interestingness around serendipity of
  just being able to stumble into someone at the watercooler and have a
  conversation with them that you don't quite get in the structured you know
  zoom world I'm wondering then if this opens up more serendipity I guess my
  mode of thinking there is if a company's trying to hire someone they might now
  eliminate some of those additional costs in terms of flying people in and and
  they're more likely to hire someone who who wouldn't move to that city do you
  think that opens up at all yeah I mean I think that's right I think to two
  things will drive that one will be the fact that everyone is now fully
  experimented with remote work and then I think the other is you know the
  cooling winds of a recession will happen and so I think people will be more
  sensitive to cost gotcha one thing you're talking about is just now this
  talent coming and something that I admire about you is just your ability of
  the tech talent and I'm wondering when you're meeting we'll call it a founder
  what are your spidey senses going off when you come around someone who's
  incredibly talented or are there certain things that you just see continue to
  pop up over and over again you know it's funny this question in many ways has
  been one that has been in the back of my mind for decade and I think about it
  constantly and I've spoken to other Talent Assessors about it endlessly and
  you know one day maybe I if I'm brave enough I'll write a book about it
  because I think it's a very interesting topic and I I feel like I'm still
  learning in this area so I'm not quite ready for the capstone project of a
  book but here's the thing I mean having gone back and forth on psychometrics
  I've read every single paper there is on that stuff I haven't gone back and
  forth on you know the role of IQ and intellect ever read most papers on that
  material there's something that's not captured by any of these frameworks
  which i think is much more important which is kind of just the raw energy and
  vitality you get from someone and I think I'd much rather take a bet on
  someone who had who will be able to play a thousand chess games then take a
  bet on someone who seems like they have merely the energy to play one and but
  you know statistically maybe they have high odds of winning that one game the
  reason is there's so much randomness in what is required to to kind of become
  successful the game has many more layers of dimensionality than than chess
  does you really want someone who's just going to have the energy to take
  multiple shots on goal until they succeed and and that's the big thing to
  focus on if like the world there's a simulation game you want someone who you
  can say no matter what they do no matter what the initial parameters are if
  you ran the simulation ten thousand times they'll probably come up just
  constantly giving it a shot and you know on their feet you know a relatively
  high percentage of the times um I think that is the big thing to look for you
  know Paul Graham talks about being looking Fifi wanting to feel intimidated
  while he's in the room with the other founder that being the emotion he seeks
  I think that that's kind of related to this form of energy if the person is
  dynamic if the person is driven if the person believes then then I think they
  become very interesting and I think that matters more than where I intellect
  and I think that matters more than any particular psychometric attribute so I
  would say you know mostly that's that's what's on my mind and I'm surprised
  I'm surprised because what I'm talking about seems pretty plain and it seems
  like a lot or if all people should have it but it's certainly not the case and
  I think even at an early level you can look at someone who's not even certain
  about what they're working on but if they have the energy they will succeed
  you've got me really intrigued now by a problem that you haven't solved yet
  and I almost view this as a creative type process for you trying to uncover
  that and I'm just really intrigued about your overall creative process it's
  something I've never heard you talk about before so so when you have a new
  idea like that you can even just call it something you you want to do a blog
  post around what's your creative process like it seems like you may do
  multiple thought experiments and run scenarios through your head yeah I mean
  the interesting thing I've been thinking about with with all of this is um
  when you want to start writing something down I find that I think this is true
  for many people the idea jumbles around in my head like a rock tumbler
  refining or finding or finding we're finding until I start writing it down and
  then once I started writing it down there's like a pressure release it's like
  a like a pressure cooker that has you know is letting off steam and it and it
  tumbles around my head a little bit less so there's a little bit of a
  counterintuitive crazy idea that works well for me and I've had I've spoken to
  people that have the opposite strategy but mine is to let it jumbled around in
  my head until I'm kind of I feel like I'm ready and then I I'm then once I
  ride I usually write it you know once fairly quickly and kind of get it out
  the door and I while the topic is kind of germinating or hopefully we're
  finding I'll definitely talk about it with other people and and think about it
  but I find you know I don't exactly know what it is but at some point I think
  my mind feel like the task has been done if I start writing and and the idea
  has kind of left my mind so I'm you know I I'm realizing this as I tell you my
  creative process is a quite chaotic in that sense that I will let something
  just jumbled around endlessly look the idea jumbled around endlessly until
  until I feel like it's gotten to a point where it's worthwhile yeah that
  rumination process is always one that intrigues me I'm wondering though when
  when something's been germinating in your head and you decide to take next
  steps how do you decide on it's something that's going to be worth the next
  steps for you I don't really and I never know I never know you know it's a
  this is kind of what I'm trying to convey to people at scale but I never
  really know I'm an I'm often surprised didn't even the surface area of just
  writing posts on the Internet I'm a very bad predictor in which post will be
  popular and it's certainly not correlated to the time I spend on it you know
  sometimes people really seem to enjoy something that took me 20 minutes to
  write and no one seems to care about the thing that I spent hours thinking
  about and so as a result I I don't overthink it too much and I think I write
  up a lot of things in it where in hindsight of course as I've read them the my
  dynamic is just wondering why even bother publishing such a terrible idea but
  I think that's just my own psyche but I think it's important not not to really
  overthink it and to try to get out there there is this psychometric property
  of industriousness people talk about um which is not you know really an
  assessment on say the quality or the how would you say that the finesse of
  anyone's worked but just their raw output and you know someone high-end
  industriousness will just have raw hi we're all output they'll just be
  producing a lot often not even aware of why or how or how much they're
  producing they're just doing it kind of on autopilot and that I think that's
  an interesting thing to shoot for because again I think you know whether it's
  a company a blog post you know a piece of music I don't know that you know
  when it's so small whether it's gonna be good or not so you know III do think
  it's useful to UM to kind of just get something out there and then try to get
  feedback and then you know or show it to customers in many ways or earlier
  rather than later and and the process of showing it to customers is not always
  pleasant but but that's fine it kind of makes you better it's not always
  pleasant of course because then you know when you worry in the back of your
  mind that you know they're not gonna love it so I understand you know the
  quote great artists ship its it it takes a certain element of fearlessness to
  do that putting yourself out there is never easy you're talking about all
  these things that you might not necessarily know the answer to I'm hoping you
  might have an answer to this one just in what area of your life do you think
  you have the best taste for you know that's a fun question I think I have a
  pretty good well I can tell you it's certainly not in in wine or fashion but I
  have a think I have a pretty good taste for you kind of general markets um and
  I don't think it's it's that much of an achievement it's just you look at
  stuff enough you kind of develop a sense for it and beckons of course an
  interesting question which is this great taste to often mean that you're the
  worst person to talk to about a certain topic because you know taste in many
  ways is just kind of pattern recognition and so I think I can patent recognize
  a great market in a bad market but the world is so volatile you know maybe for
  example I'll miss the next great healthcare company because that's just
  generally a bad market it's kind of an interesting question whether well what
  is the correct amount of taste and and and maybe there areas where you have
  kind of too much taste in because there's a bit of an explore exploit thing
  going on I think where you collect more information about a certain field and
  then you become trapped I mean this happens to machine learning algorithms all
  the time you become trapped in kind of a local maximum and and you miss the
  fact that you know had you've been a little bit more explorative you know two
  spaces to your left has a much higher hill or peak so I think it's a very
  interesting question to think about maybe over the weekend it wouldn't spend
  too many hours is the cyclic through this on a Thursday but um as to as to
  what the correct amount of taste is but it's it's clear to me that the the
  kind of dose response curve there is kind of an inverse U shape where you want
  some amount of it but not all of it I love how you reframe that now you have
  me thinking through this differently because when I ask the question of Moe's
  intrigue next about is do you work in that area and then kind of like why or
  why not so I like how you reach if did that for me what about just in terms of
  you you've been around a lot of people youyou've self-assess a lot what are
  most people just not paying attention to what are they did you think they
  would just dramatically increase their overall success in life and life
  happiness and define that how you may I think people are not I mean I found
  myself I think there's that so there's a strong desire now I think from the
  entire world to kind of get very much focused I don't know on on you know
  taking care of yourself and you know trying to be mindful and all that kind of
  stuff but I feel like that is you know grossly overrated in comparison to
  managing the inputs in your life you know the people you're surrounded by the
  food you eat the information that you read I think it's much easier to just
  try to optimize those things instead of trying to optimize what your brain
  does with everything you throw at it if that makes sense like I think if you
  have bad voltage you know in your in terms of what you plug yourself into I
  think you'll have you know spiky output you know you don't want to try to
  assume that you're gonna have a you know transformer in your body so feel like
  that's a pretty large underrated thing and of course beckons the question
  where like you know how do you change those inputs if you don't really have
  control over them if you're kind of just stuck somewhere the good news is the
  Internet is this vast equalizing landscape I mean it's really incredible when
  you think about it my internet is the same as a billionaire's internet which
  is the same as the Internet of someone in India right now for the most part
  pretty identical sure maybe slightly faster upload speeds whatever but for the
  most part it's the same and that's really beautiful that means you can kind of
  get in touch with anyone find a community for yourself and I think that's the
  that's a that's a very big thing to pay attention to you know we we are the
  average of the people we spend time with and you want to figure out ways to
  spend time with great people to increase your average so I think it's a pretty
  big thing I think I mean yeah I mean I think this the whole debate on I'm kind
  of in my I mean this is a little bit controversial but the whole mental health
  debate I think pales in comparison to say the debate around proper sleep and I
  often wonder how many hours have had space or meditation you accomplish in
  literally an hour of REM sleep and I think a lot of people early on in life
  have a strong desire to perform through output that is to say they want to be
  seen as cycling the bicycle as aggressively as possible but the world really
  doesn't care sorry about input the world really doesn't care about you know
  how much effort you put in the world really cares about how much output you
  have and you and you want to be working hard and smart you know not just hard
  yeah so I've got a question around that and so I'm really curious then how you
  spend the majority of your time and what are you using as barometer for your
  return on that invested time that's a good question I spend the majority of my
  time working and interfacing with you know pioneers founders people you know
  early-stage companies working on pioneer itself of course just trying to
  figure out what to improve what to fix we just launched this new thing called
  frontier she's kind of like a an interesting directory of cool projects kind
  of built online that kind of takes the shape of a subreddit so you know
  thinking about that working through that how to how to make it grow how to
  make it popular how to also make sure that it you know has a kind of a good
  community driving behind it it's something at the top of mind for me and you
  know the way I view the return on time there is it's pretty I mean it's pretty
  chaotic in the sense that we have metrics we look at first say the company of
  pioneer you know the people were funding the quality of the people were
  funding our other people funding the people that were funding that type of
  thing they're kind of obvious stuff you would be looking at I think if if you
  were in the organization you know and and and for me personally so much of my
  personal you know kind of personal on social capital is equities din that
  thing I spend a lot of time Dave I mean if that were successful I would be
  happily successful but I think the other thing that's important is you know
  even yeah outside of the main game you know just being helpful to close
  friends being helpful to family other people perceiving you as useful I think
  is the is the main thing I'd like and I feel like I often need maybe it's a
  flaw of mine to be dependent on and so you know I for me being able to produce
  something that other people find worthwhile that other people find useful you
  know be that an email a piece of software anything really that for me is joy
  well to be honest you're certainly checking the box there for me you've been
  incredibly helpful over the last year with your with your writing
  conversations just overall lessons learned so thanks for that I know you've
  got a lot going on today so I just I want to want to finish up with with two
  quick ones here and if we're just gonna be sitting down having this
  conversation in three years from now what do you need to have have happened
  that you just feel overall happy with the progress pioneer in yourself yeah I
  mean success for us in success for me for for pioneer is to be we want to be
  equity holders in hundreds of great businesses that are obviously valued as
  great themselves you know I think if the aggregate market cap of a pioneer
  companies was a hundred billion dollars we've consider ourselves certainly on
  the path to success and like I said I think the world could stand to have
  significantly more small companies you know in trade of you know four or five
  large tech giants and so if we could help increase the amount of variety the
  amount of kind of novelty in the world that way I think we'd be hugely
  successful so that's the trick for us you know it's it's not about having a
  billion users pioneers is not a really a tool for the masses it's a tool for
  the elite for the top one percent they don't even realize they're the one
  percent this isn't you know that the net worth one percent this is kind of the
  weird one percent the outsiders the top one percent Outsiders if we can find a
  way to find those limited number of people and to be clear I think there are
  millions of them but again not billions and get be at the ground floor as they
  start their business and propel them into success you know I think III think
  we feel pretty happy with our tombstone so that's the main thing we're
  shooting for is kind of being equity holders in hundreds of successful
  businesses doing a you know a whole eclectic mix of things Daniel I love it
  it's inspiring it's truly great work that you guys are helping so many people
  across the globe so final one here I'm always intrigued about what's coming
  through your your brain in terms of what you're reading and then who you just
  favorite thinkers of all time are I know you've mentioned Churchill a few
  times in this conversation we just love to get most updated new books or
  things that you've enjoyed reading and then who you just admire as a thinker
  sure yeah I mean there is actually a nutritional book that came out this year
  so that that's been an enjoyable one to read there's a really great book I
  only would recommend it to someone who runs it's an old book but it's a really
  great book possibly the greatest training book of all time let's see if I can
  pull up the name here you know it's funny a byproduct of reading on Kindle is
  I'm most familiar with the title of things III's that question someone asked
  me that last night and I couldn't remember probably five the last ten based on
  that so the book is called once a runner and it's really good if you're into
  running if you're not you know a wedding of the waters was a book that was
  recommended to me is about the construction of the Erie Canal I found that
  incredibly fascinating one that I'm just finishing now that I picked up
  recently is a book titled chaos as the Charles Manson book you know it's well
  it's if if you like the intellectual thrill of a conspiracy theory I think
  it's very interesting you know I don't know how knowledgeable or how
  informational it is just finishing Robert Caro's latest on Lyndon Johnson
  that's that's a kind of an endless song you start reading that and you never
  get it when a Strasse t yeah that's that's a bit of a capstone project maybe
  one final one I'd recommend I kind of really enjoyed was Copeland the secret
  history of the sacona quote secret history of Koch Industries I find that very
  interesting book paints a mixed picture and I think that's important I think
  it would have been very easy for the author to write the negative story but
  it's mixed positive and negative and yeah so so that was interesting maybe too
  I mean sorry you've now tripped me the man who solved the market I thought was
  super fascinating this is a book about Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies
  is a very interesting book about about the company and then maybe one final
  one is leadership and more andrew roberts book andrew roberts has written a
  tremendous amount of by he's about leaders during including Churchill this one
  is kind of how would you say snippets of areas of leadership you know from
  different leaders around the world so it's kind of a compressed way of reading
  his book some of the chapters are great some of the chapters are bad I'd
  encourage the reader to kind of leaf through it in non-sequential order from
  him we knew you know whatever they find most interesting it's funny you and I
  must be thinking through the same lens because those last three Copeland what
  did a deep dive on him reading Roberts right now and then Jim Simon's we had
  on the author Greg Zuckerman about a month or two ago but those first few I'd
  never heard of so I'm pumped to dive into those great awesome well Daniel this
  is always fun I always walk away from these conversations thinking differently
  for the listeners who are unfamiliar with you everything that's going on at
  pioneer we're gonna have it all linked up but anywhere else you want them
  checking out staying connected with you now that's great I mean my email is on
  my Twitter bio so you should feel free to email me and that's kind of it I
  mean people I think I think if if you feel like you shouldn't check out
  pioneer that is the exact type of person that should check out pioneer so give
  it a gander and or of course they're always very curious about the experience
  people go through not just learning about what they're working on so please
  send it any feedback you have our way yeah highly recommend you guys check it
  out it's fascinating and all of you Builders out there make sure you guys get
  on there and and and see if you can get some funding through pioneer but
  Daniel gross once again I can't thank you enough for joining us on what got
  you there thank you so much for having me like you guys made it to the end of
  another episode of what got you there I hope you guys enjoyed it I really do
  appreciate you taking the time to listen all the way through if you found

I'm Sean Delaney and you're listening to what got you there what got you there is a must follow for entrepreneurs creatives high achievers and changemakers each week I sit down with some of the world's most influential people and focus on the journey behind their success we uncover the strategy tactics and routines that help them get there now it's your journey so it's time to learn what's going to get you there what got you there with Sean Delaney what got you there with sounded lady what got you there with Sean the lady I think as a society we want more variety we want more choice we want more weirdness we don't want to live in a world where there's four or five large tech companies it'd be great to live in the world where there's a thousand small tech companies and I think in order to create that we need to literally create and generate more founders and I don't think it's that the world is lacking in sufficient IQ or people that would be smart enough or people that would be gritty enough I think it's that the world is lacking in a way to kind of radicalize people to pursue their passions Daniel Gross is the founder of Pioneer a fully remote accelerator that backs brilliant founders from all over the world pioneer is changing the way that companies are formed and pioneer has already backed more than 100 founders Daniel's origin story begins in Israel and when he was 18 he was accepted into Y Combinator being the youngest founder ever at that time he founded a company called Q an AI powered search engine that was acquired by Apple when he was just 22 Daniel was a previous guest on episode number 124 and if you haven't heard it go ahead and check that out so on this episode Sean and Daniel discuss a wide range of topics from Daniel's decision making process his recent marathon in Antarctica what he's seen most in the most successful entrepreneurs and so much more making change transpire that's the mission behind the most amazing tasting protein bar brand taking the nutrition industry by storm that brand their MC Tico and they make the most delicious keto friendly all natural collagen protein bars if you're obsessed with the quality of food

looks like after k√∂ppen 19 but I have to hear about the marathon you recently ran in Antarctica how is that I wouldn't know what that experience was like sure it thanks again for having me on I'm delighted to talk I recently finished running yeah a bunch of miles marathon in Antarctica in all honesty most of the credit in will fame or infamy it goes to go to my friend Kyle fo who who I was pacing Kyle was running seven marathons and seven continents and trying to set the record for doing it in 77 hours he ended up completing the feat in about I think 84 or 85 hours still shattering the record by quite some bit and I paced him for a few of those marathons certainly not all of them but the first one that we ran was in Antarctica very interesting place quite desolate I think the best way to envision it is if you have ever been in a desert you can kind of imagine that just with with the you know with with the conditions you'd expect much colder snow wind we think Faline ice visibility actually there was a marathon that was around about 48 hours prior to us and we were kind of looking at finishing times there and fastest finishing times four hours and change and you know for a marathon usually it's just slightly under half of that you know you know two hours 20 minutes for a speedy finish so if the you know top finishers finishing at 4 hours that means conditions are really bad so we were kind of getting worried ourselves figured we power through regardless but we had a little bit of wind but it was pretty nice regardless packed snow you know you kind of think of this surface being like a kind of a beach a style and in terms of the impact you get from it and so that means that it's actually a little bit easier on your knees but you have to apply a little bit more force because you're getting less force back from the ground you're sinking a little bit in each step so it takes out you know surprising amount of you but it's just a thrilling place to be and and you know running I find has this interesting effect where it really encodes things into memory you know I find if I'm on vacation and then go run I really remember the area that I ran in and the sort of salt day even though we ran kind of laps around the airfield that we landed in I remember it intently intensely he's running an environment much different do your senses or are they impacted differently then than just a normal run call it out in San Francisco well I mean certainly in it's much colder and and so you know I think if an East Coast run it would probably be pretty familiar with just running in the snow and the cold so you know certain parts of you get get numb I mean surprisingly your chest and torso warm up as long as you keep on moving but you know you you gotta have good gloves to keep the the fingers warm and you know we wore Deborah double-layer socks just to just to keep the extremities warm the actual you know aspect of running is not that different we for all of the marathons we ended up running you know either out in backs or laps near the airport and so you know you were you were kind of just you know keeping track of the mileage that we're doing but other than that you know it wasn't too distinct it's a sea level so you know the amount of oxygen you have is as great we were just trying to make sure that you know we didn't go out too strong Kyle had another six marathons after Antarctica and so we were you know trying to keep a moderate pace but you know other than that the the only way you'd know you you were in Antarctica I think is is well just by the infinite horizon of snow and again we caught it on a good day I mething third days where there's um you could you can really experience the full scope of nature's wrath in Antarctica and it's you know as I understand the conditions can get quite tough but but for us on a beautiful day was it was like a windy snowed in day maybe on the East Coast how'd that opportunity even come to you I've known Kyle for quite some time as an investor and his company is called cruise got acquired by General Motors for about a billion dollars that building self-driving cars and indeed maybe one of the first to market and I've known him for quite some time prior to that while he was running his earlier company which would turn into justin.tv which would turn it of course into switch into twitch and we've kind of been old friends and I think he knows I'm up for adventures in particular running adventures and so at some point around Christmas he told me he was gonna do this and you know it's I find it kind of interesting I don't know why I said yes but it was very clear to me that I had to do it once the opportunity was available yeah that's what I'm curious about those adventures you're going after and I'm even intrigued do you learn new things about yourself after taking on something like that um yeah I mean I enjoy finding me and I don't think I'm alone I think a lot of people enjoy fine you know finding the limits of my body and my mind you know it's I think you learn maybe a little bit less you know something specific about yourself and more I think you just gain confidence knowing that you know you did that really hard thing and so whatever you're staring at you can probably you know get over and III that's why I started running in the first place yeah I'm wondering even how you I know for me internally when I take on one of those challenges it's almost like a new bar has been raised and set we're now that confidence that I was able to tackle that you can go on to to more intense challenging things so I'm wondering finding the limits for you when you think about that that phrase what comes to mind both internally in terms of difficulty with your mind and then also physical challenges well I mean I for me I'll be honest with you you know I'm um I'm the by no means perfect in this regard I also am very close to and mostly do this this sport that happened to love which is running and you know and and as you know once you kind of get into running it's it's not as hard as it seems but it's it does seem to the outside are very crazy I think when you tell them even though I just you know I ran it's 13 or 14 miles today um you know to the to an outsider that seems very crazy and and hard but you know for me it's it's it's not easy but it's a thrill and it's certainly something I enjoy so you know I I'm not as good as others about constantly kind of stretching and driving different sports although I am interested in it running for me has also very nice efficiency to it there's only so much you can do of it it's it's it's quite um you know it takes quite a toll on your body you could go out and you could bike ride for five hours and be fine you you can't really run for five hours I mean you can but you know you're not gonna be able to work afterwards or run the next day so for me it's very nice in the sense that it's very you know it's very efficient um you know I'm gonna go running at some point later today and you know it'll be about 50 minutes of my time but it'll yield dividends greater than 50 minutes in terms of my productivity for the rest of the day and and it still kind of stresses my body there I don't think there's actually a better way probably just in in just in terms of minutes and and maybe overall longevity benefits I don't think there's something much better than running but but that being said you know I I enjoy within within that sport I enjoy trying to find the limits you know either trying to get faster or trying just you know a distance I haven't tried are kind of like the novelty of it and and and and I think it's quite I mean for me it's very helpful to have something other than work that's kind of a game I can work on something I could thinking about and something I can win and maybe lose it but it's it's very helpful you know you work has its ups and downs not all of which I could control and it's quite nice to you know even during a day that you know might be quite intense from a work perspective have that have it just another different thing to work on I think other people have you know other forms of these outlets you know one day if I'm lucky enough maybe I'll have children maybe that will become that and or you know sometimes I go play video games I kind of get it it's nice to be able to escape almost to a different universe and so that's that's really maybe another thing that I get out of it but you know I I look I love challenge adventure and and I think if I if I had a little bit more more free time I would think about more creative things to do Kyle was very inspiring to me in that regard I mean here's a fairly busy individual running a very large unit within a very large company working on one of the most important software hardware projects of the 21st century arguably and yet you know he thought of this he made the time and he actually did it um very very much kind of you know made me think gosh you know I I'd love to do some style of particular adventure like that in the future you know something at the intersection of running logistics software I should say Kyle were actually wrote an open sourced actual software he had to write to do this because you know you have the traditional quite famous software problem called the Traveling Salesman problem when you ask yourself the question you know if I want to run in seven continents in the shortest period of time you know given everything you know about you know airports and flights what is the most efficient way to do that and software actually answer that question and so it's a very very cool project truly at the intersection of that man's interests and yeah maybe one day I'll grow up and I'll do something similar do you have anything in mind in terms of what you'd like to tackle there well you know hopefully at some point in in the Farfetch'd feature when there was a vaccine and this thing is behind us I do think traveling to kind of interesting new desolate places is is very interesting you know so much of our memory as humans is spatial we remember things based on place I certainly I'm experiencing now I don't know if you are but you know now that we're all kind of in lockdown and we're not moving around although the day-to-day of my life hasn't changed that much in terms of what I do I find that remember much less of it just because it's all blurry um you know I think it turned out that afternoon coffee you were getting half of the value was a cup of coffee half of it was just going to another place and breaking up the day a little bit and so that's kind of making me even forgot shouldn't be it'd be great to do some type of travel to you know really remote places where you're constantly changing locations all the time I look I've I've stared down at a lot of weird records and again it's so funny I don't even understand why I would go do it you know I'm everything from longest time someone's you know ran on a treadmill to you know the longest set of contiguous marathons to all sorts of weird stuff and yeah it's it's it's we were kind of kidding to ourselves as we were running the second marathon which was in Argentina that we don't we didn't even really know why we were doing that you know at a deep level just felt like it had to happen so I don't know anything specific yet but but I am excited by the thrill of it I think it'd be really interesting to traverse more of Antarctica I think that that continent not only is it the only continent without coronavirus but it's I mean it's very underrated and it's a very interesting place there are fractions of Antarctica that are unclaimed by any other nation and yet larger than you know California State and so that's that's a pretty fascinating thing when you think about it I mean there's land that is larger than countries that no one's really claiming and you know the the the eye of the of the world is really towards you know Mars maybe rightfully so it's very interesting but here right right here on earth we a lot of undiscovered stuff you know the other thing that I'm super fascinated by is the ocean just the underwater life super undiscovered and there are all sorts of interesting treasures underwater that we used to have a culture of going after you know people looking for sunken booty and ships and you know that all kind of faded at some point but you know there's a lot of interesting stuff there Jeff besos plucked out of the water Apollo 11s original saturn v engine and that now sits somewhere in his one of his homes I mean that's incredible what a piece of art to have and there's plenty more of that interesting stuff you know at the bottom of the ocean we don't really know how to traverse it but that's another form of management that I think would be incredibly interesting to to go and explore yeah interesting people doing interesting things and you're certainly at the intersection of that and you're bringing up some of these things that that you're intrigued by that your curiosity is being piqued with what are those moments like when your curiosity is piqued when you talk about underwater discoveries and things like that what our next steps for you when you get intrigued by something yeah it's funny I I'm smiling because I think the broader topic of motivation what pulls one in different directions is very interesting and it's something I well I mean collectively the whole team at pioneer spent a huge amount of time thinking on because let's imagine we could crack this let's imagine I could tell you I kind of know I've we've reverse engineered motivation and here's like a script we can write where we can kind of motivate anyone to do anything boy I mean that would be incredible we could fix so much of the world problems I think we could create many more startups as a result like my dream for pioneer isn't it for it to be a startup accelerator it is for it to be a start-up a generator to create more companies that wouldn't have been possible before and I think the way we would go about doing that is we would kind of buy into the assumption that there are thousands of amazing companies you know your next stripe Facebook Pinterest snapchat whatever that are you know github repos with tenkan Mithen where the person then gave up because they lost motivation and and and I understand it and I think everyone can understand this right you working on anything there's a kind of an ebb and flow to it and I feel like the world broadly speaking all the jobs in the world could be separated into maybe one of two buckets the first we could kind of think of as you know clear we could kind of call them clear jobs where it's very clear what to do next so this would be anything from working in the military to working at Starbucks it's very clear how to advance in the career it's very clear what the next mission is it's very clear with the you know the next thing to do working on a large company is the same you have a boss the boss gives you work you do the work the boss gives you a is great but then there are opaque jobs and opaque jobs unlike clear jobs it's not clear what to do next it's not really clear where the motivation should come from it's not really clear what success would look like you know we can kind of think of an opaque job as the job of someone working as an early-stage founder I actually think investors are somewhat similar um it's not always clear what to invest in what to do and in an opaque job and you know I feel like there are a lot of casualties of motivation where yet you kind of are working on something and because there's no external validation you just stop doing it for you know at some point and so motivation comes in these you know fits and starts and and and it's very unclear to anyone really what what drives it what causes it in and the role of pioneer is at least for the world of kind of early-stage startup and company building to try to take people that have otherwise would have given up and to propel them into this treadmill of productivity to get them going and and to get them to work on it a little bit more harder you know for every time you know when I was 18 years old for every time I thought of applying to Y Combinator or trying to you know email someone at Sequoia for money there maybe 20 times where I just kind of self edited out of that well you know doesn't seem like a real thing why bother and move on and then at some point I kind of did it and you know to our earlier conversation I expense a lot of parallels here with running where I didn't take running seriously for a very long time and then I accidentally signed up for a marathon I don't know maybe a half a decade or longer ago and then I accidentally told people I signed up for a marathon and one thing leads to the next and suddenly I'm running intervals in a track so you know there are all these ways to kind of propel yourself or force yourself to do things and we want to instrument that in software in what Pioneer does and so we have this whole mechanic around you know a leaderboard and points and all that gamification is really in service of getting people to go the extra mile for themselves really it's very much how like the the whole peloton platform you know the bike the treadmill they have gets people to workout a little bit more and and so you know for me the whole ah you know story around curiosity and motivation it really is the dissecting that and solving that and breaking that apart is is I think the key to creating kind of more startups in the world which I should mention is something we want like I think as a society we want more variety we want more choice we want more weirdness we don't want to live in a world where there's four or five large tech companies it would be great to live in the world where there's a thousand small tech companies and I think in order to create that we need to literally create and generate more founders and I don't think it's that the world is lacking sufficient IQ or people that would be smart enough or people that would be gritty enough I think it's that the world is lacking in a way to kind of for addict allows people to pursue their passions and that's the purpose of Pioneer yeah that's just such an interesting hypothesis it makes me even think back I grew up playing sports so I had a sports background I don't even just think about some of those little motivations those little nudges that a certain coach maybe gave me at one of those inflection points and that little bit of motivation just helped me go so much further along my own progress and and you're talking about doing this in terms of companies and founders and and you're assessing hundreds of not thousands of founders per year and I'm wondering do you believe that you really can dissect what motivates them and what-what that curiosity looks like it's interesting because I think you kind of answer the question with your earlier point so you know when the coach when when when you're running or doing any sport and in if you have the right psychology of kind of you know kind of an insecure overachiever what's gonna happen is you are going to be your largest critic and your largest kind of enemy the voice inside your head you know that says this wasn't good enough you know I bet this was bad you should try harder and and so you tend to push yourself you know to two extremes pretty quickly and it's just when you were kind of gonna give up on the whole thing because why bother and maybe you know you know everything you do is just not great enough where the coach says that was a great set and that really changes things inside you and we see this kind of on the internet if I'm very tickled by it you know someone will get just a like on Twitter or Facebook from someone they admire and that will change them for the day maybe the week and so you know I think as humans I think it's actually fairly healthy that we look for a sense of accomplishment from other humans I mean if we didn't have that we would all off be doing crazy things maybe bad things I think in many ways that's that's kind of what morality is the sense that if I did this other humans would perceive it badly so I shouldn't do that and that kind of makes sense that at a global scale now like everything taken to an extreme I think it's bad you know you don't want to be entirely driven by what other people think because I think then then you get stuck in the cycle of conventionalism but having the you know the right people be ones that you kind of you perform for and you admire I think is it's both you know true and important and so what I think we can do is I think we can and try to engineer mechanics where you know one of two things happens either you get a sense of approval from like say a coach that what you're doing is great and you should move on and you should take that a little bit more seriously and you know and that for us can be the you know pioneer is an opaque thing could be one of our experts and then of course the other thing is just this this element of the other thing that's very pleasant in sports is you know kind of when you're playing and you where you rank and you're kind of not winning all the time nor are you losing all the time and you get a sense of how you're improving and that's one of them in one of the ways where I think you know pioneers kind of leaderboard mechanic is quite effective you you constantly get a sense kind of of where you are and how you're improving and some people love competing against others other people really love just competing against themselves and just you know everyone wants to kind of get better every day and so I think with its kind of two mechanics you know nudges from kind of coaches to your point as well as a constant sense of improvement we can you know get people to trip into building their their kind of next great thing and let's not forget this is not to a far-fetched of a claim because if we look a little bit closer at the earlier versions of say Facebook where you can have you can watch interviews with Mark Zuckerberg from 2005 where you know he very much decries the platform ever-growing beyond you know Harvard just a small Harvard photo directory or I mean in all honesty even Elon Musk where you know SpaceX was set up as basically a giant photo op on on Mars that was the plan let's buy some Russian rockets launched a bunch of then on to Mars get it to take a photo of what life is like on Mars and then shut down the company you know lo and behold Facebook of course turns into the largest not even social network but maybe you know um you kind of kind of human directory service in the world and SpaceX is the largest private space company you know far more successful than many nation-states they were not started in that way they were started as fairly dumb simple projects and things really evolved over time so so so if you if you inspect closely that and I and I get a lot of joy by looking at early versions of you know Facebook or Amazon or Google by the way Google University project called backrub for chrissake you you you're kind of reminded that everything big start small and that is I think really important to remember because if you if you if you believe that then I think you automatically believe that more small things could could become big you bring up another really interesting thread about how some of these gigantic organizations have started small with a simple idea and I know you've kind of seen behind closed doors of some of the world's leaders in terms of technology and I would love to know what it's like behind those doors are they just like everyone else because I think young entrepreneurs are people interested in starting a company they look up to a Bezos and and they think he's just operating at such a different level and and that might be a bad example because he might be but I'm wondering the majority of people are are there enough people who can emulate them to some degree with enough time and experience yeah I mean for me I I grew up adoring apple just adoring it I didn't have all the Apple products but I certainly knew about every single one of them and I was very much I thought myself a disciple of Steve Jobs you know watching there was a YouTube channel I think it shut down called every Steve Jobs video and this is back in the day where you could like watch the entirety of YouTube but I think I watched every video on every Steve Jobs video and you never properly met the man my only runnin with him was a literal run and where he almost ran me over once but when once we got acquired by Apple Steve was had unfortunately already passed but I was very curious to meet the rest of the leadership of at the time the world's largest company and and really get a sense for you know for what these inhuman gods were like and of course you go and you meet folks and you know I don't know if you've ever had the experience is like meeting rock stars or people you grew up admiring but you meet them and you constantly have the same reflection which is gosh no human they're human just like me and you know I don't mean to demean them they're much smarter than me and you know there is a real intelligence to some of apples leadership is the main thing I can I can speak about at large you know fortune 50 list having spent a lot of time with those guys I mean every Apple leader themselves could could and is running actually a fortune 50 company in terms of revenue they're very smart but they're very human too and you know they have their you know their eccentric disease and their flaws and it's a real reminder that that you know you're not that different from them for me one of the biggest moments in in my life where I kind of realized I could do it is I remember when I came out here Mark Zuckerberg came to give a talk and in all honesty you know at the time Facebook was you know weirdly even more hype than it is now it was kind of before it was it was on that's ascendancy in the s-curve but just seeing him talk and and seeing him it you know in the flash made me realize well you know he's human I'm human so I'm sure I can figure something out and you know maybe it won't become Facebook but it'll be something and I think that's the thing for people to realize is you see all of these people through screens and you see them in their fully manicured form you know don't forget when you watch someone like even Mark Zuckerberg or even Elon you know both who are you know certainly know churchill's in terms of they're all raishin ability these are people that have gone through hours of media training hours of staring at themselves on video and just trying to figure out how to perfect how to improve and you know maybe they don't give a damn but certainly they have media teams just working on polishing the image over and over and over and and they're meant to project force power and pride it's it's obviously in their best interest to do that given where they are but you know but behind that is someone who you know is very similar if not identical to any kind of early stage founder so look there is something something smart unique oh wow Siri just turned out on my computer sorry about that um there are something smart and unique about those people but you know I don't think it's a a million thing I think it's a one in a thousand thing I'm someone interested how you view that now when you have young entrepreneurs young founders come up to you who are viewing you in that light as well I mean here you came from another country got acquired for tens of millions are building some incredible things out there in the world so how do you think about that now since you're still so close to that when you have young people reach out to you yep you know III try to make my set up my time in the kind of this barbell approach forum but you know very interested in meeting on people that have been underrated by the world you know Outsiders people that dumb you know feel like they they they don't belong wherever they are but they also aren't you know quite you know at at their peak moment of Fame here in Silicon Valley you know knew the other extreme I try to spend a lot of time with kind of existing close friends and you know it's important for me to you know to communicate you know to everyone that I meet that's kind of just getting started that you know that they can do it I mean it's the that's the biggest message I try to deliver to people it's very interesting to think though and to wonder you know at the end of the day a lot of people ask me the following question you know when they reach out is like what you so what will I learn by coming out to say Silicon Valley that I you know that I can't learn online or what is it at the end of the day that you know investors or places like Y Combinator are teaching people and and you know the the funny thing is a lot of people think you know they're gonna they're gonna be learning if like us like some secret rule um you know in formula that's really kept here like that you know it's like the coke formula or something um the reality that is and the thing I try to convey people to people when I meet them is that the main thing of Silicon Valley like the big idea here you that in certain properties in the world to the internet being one of those worlds you can grow much faster than you anticipate that is the big thing people don't realize you know they're they're sending ten emails a week not a hundred thousand emails a week they're trying to grow revenue a thousand dollars a month not a million dollars a month and and people kind of forget the math of CagA of the compounding annual growth rate or weekly growth rate you know 5% week over week starts to add up really quickly I highly would encourage everyone I mean I you know I guess now with coronavirus we're a little bit more aware of what 33% every week means but you can open a spreadsheet and you can just do the math of 5% week over week and put in any number that you care about the number of users you have the number of revenue you're chasing and and things start stacking in this weird way where it's as again it's very kind of non-intuitive to the human mind and it's really teaching that to people it's teaching to people that you can get big and you can grow big that I think is the main lesson of Silicon Valley you can kind of think of here's a fun analogy like the world basically has all of these computers that could do amazing things but they've all been under clocked by the manufacturer and and what Silicon Valley really tries to do is I don't know if it's overclocking or getting them to the correct clock speed but it is certainly increasing the the kind of strength and the speed of the processor itself in people when did you learn that lesson was it after coming to Silicon Valley or were you aware of that before no I wasn't I mean I grew up in Israel and I would read articles about tak Ranch about Silicon Valley and it seemed to me as as as as foreign as middle-earth I mean it's obviously a place maybe fictional amazing things happening there you know Elrond and Gandalf walking around but certainly not a place I can access and then I came out here and then I suddenly know I was here and I remember I just you know all these companies some of them would go under over time but I you know was walking around kind of the the bay area and I see the offices of you know Foursquare and Gowalla you know the time location-based social networks were all the hype this 2009 2010 and I'm a la I felt like I was on a movie set and uh and I had no idea I think I had no idea that things get big but then you know you meet people you have friends and then what happens is your friends occasionally some of them and their companies you know start to do really well and they start grossing millions of dollars in revenue and you're looking around and you're staring at your hands and you're staring at their hands and then you're staring at your hands and you're saying well we both have ten fingers so obviously I could be doing more and so there's this interesting positive form of competition where it's not I'm trying to eat away at their successes their success is motivating me to realize I can do much more so again so like humans aren't born with the sense that they can start a company that turns into Amazon and you know what statistically the odds are that it won't happen but when it does happen to someone it'll it'll be started by the same person as you that's the person listening to this and that's a super important lesson and I didn't I mean I certainly didn't know that in it and it took me you know quite some time to internalize but it's funny now that I have that I find I find there's a certain element of confidence in it that you know that I know that I I'll figure it out and I'll get there and it's very similar going back to how we open the conversation for me I found it very helpful you know many years ago to finish a marathon my first marathon because I knew I could do that and that you know that makes running two miles seem like a joke so yeah I mean I don't think you're born with this some people are born with this knowledge Churchill famously was basically you know from birth thought he was there to save the world but most of us aren't born with it and it's something you discover over time yet Daniel one of the things I appreciate most about you especially during our conversations is just your ability to synthesize your ideas and your thinking it's just just a clear and concise and I mean that's just an excellent framework for someone who doesn't have this experience and I'm just wondering some of the other main frameworks and models that you found most helpful overall yeah it's funny I can't I get a lot of the kind of mental model questions uh you know I I don't have them I'm a bit more of an of a jazz improviser a bad one probably then a classical musician you know I don't have like a particular scripture I subscribed to I do think there are there are a bunch of you know mental kind of tricks or fallacies that people fall into there's plenty to be right about this online you know I think famously Charlie Munger has this book poor Charlie's Almanac which discusses this in quite length and if you don't want to read the book or buy it it's actually an expensive book oddly it's great summaries of it online but one that's been very topical for me of late with it with coronavirus is just the law of exponents and exponential growth you know doubling every week again it's it's super easy to talk about these numbers but it they're real brain Buster's doubling every week seems very fine until you go from a thousand to 2,000 to 4,000 to 8,000 to 16,000 to 32,000 and and that that is it's funny you ask for mental frameworks I use but that's like a mental framework no one can really grasp their head around one of the reasons why I actually think the bay area was a little bit more better prepare to the coronavirus than anywhere else is staring an exponential growth and dreaming of exponential growth in good forms is something we do all day and so we were quite aware of you know well it might be going from four to eight deaths but if it's doubling every week you know I think we were quite aware of how bad it could get because the those charts that those the shape of those charts is very familiar to us but I think most people don't understand that most people don't understand the math of compounding I think that it's like a that's another weird secret you know it's it's it's you can they take ya for whatever for wherever you want to be in terms of revenue you have how much money you have how many users you have you could take wherever you know whatever number that is and plug it into a spreadsheet and just set 5% growth as your target weekly and it starts out really easy and but if you manage to keep the pace you get to large numbers very quickly so it's another thing to flag for people and you were you were mentioning you're more like a jazz musician I'm wondering have you read the book effortless effortless mastery I've leased through it I wouldn't call it a red one but yeah I own it okay yeah no just talking about the the improvisation and and how you go about things it just seems similar to that framework so I just wandering him you would head check that out at all you did bring up an interesting thing though and and understanding the limits of your knowledge and what you're not capable of so are there certain things over the past year with with pioneer you guys have come across and we can call them just blind spots and I'm wondering if you've changed anything even at the margin and what that process has looked like for you yes constantly adjusting and learning you know I think the I think it's fairly well I think it's impossible for a mortal to build a product and have it be successful with literally no edits you know kind of headshot situation I think it's very possible for someone to build something that is directionally good and try to get feedback from customers the only amount of goodness you need in your product is you need sufficient goodness so that people would use it so that they will give you feedback that is it and so thankfully we have that with Pioneer and so we get copious amounts of feedback and you know one one particular thing you know that that we improved on recently is you know people I think wanted a structured way to understand you know how they would get funding from Pioneer and our you know our original kind of a funding offer was just complicated and and one of the things I'm trying to fix in the venture world is negotiation which I think no founder wants because negotiating against a VC is I think flat-out unfair you're doing a negotiation for the fourth time probably in your life and they are doing it for the fourth time you know this week so it sucks no one wants to you don't want to run your first marathon against Elliott cap Jogi so you know one thing we adjusted as a result is we made our terms incredibly transparent clear and it's it's actually we're we're gonna do it do a another step of this soon but you could literally go to the website and and and you could see what our terms are and we try to pretty much we always stick to them and so like that that was a big thing for us just because you know for me removing confusion from the venture game is incredibly important the ideal situation haven't quite arrived there yet but of course the ideal situation is you know you can envision like a Windows 98 UI or the you know get money button is grayed out and then at some point it turns you know block and you can click it and then you just get money that's it that should be obviously how this works it's like so clear when you think of it but there shouldn't be any of this weird kind of negotiation talking to different people that get money button should just turn the right color and you press in you're done and we'll get there we're not quite there but that's like a big thing we've been working on another thing we're constantly working on is improving the elements of feedback in the tournament so the way Pioneer works as you play this thing and you try to get some points and improve kind of your score week over week and one of the things that drives your score is other people kind of commenting on the progress you made over the course of a particular week and they have the ability to leave feedback for you and I must say you know part of a lot of this is due to the you know work that um the engineering team has done notably our our star copilot Rishi and a lot of its I think due to maybe community lock dynamics but the feedback on pioneer is really good and this is a big deal because as you know on Sudan as communities on the internet people are rarely nice to each other but for some reason it works and so just kind of improving the quality of the feedback in terms of you know how we show who and what is another really important thing first because you know going back to your point about the coach that nudge where someone says you know hey this was really good or even constructive criticism you know hey have you considered X or Y is really important to people because I think that can really make the difference of you know a good week and in a bad week one so go ahead I don't know one thing you brought up a little while ago that I shoulda dove deeper into now but this is kind of circling back is you're mentioning the leader board and I'd love to know how you assess this through when you're talking about certain people don't like being up on the leader board and they prefer to compete against themselves so how do you balance that it's true I took we take I mean we can take a lot of inspiration from existing games that you know have multiple modes you can play in single player and play against your shelf or you could play in multiplayer with other people now unlike a game we have this interesting problem which is the reason single-player works is you can play against let's imagine it's you know some type of strategy game or whatever you can play against an AI you can play against a computer and the computer can simulate people there's something very beautiful in that because the computer will never see your in your nakedness you know you could have a totally abysmal game and no one will know now we don't have that like we don't have if we know how to write software that would act like the way founders do then we'd have a whole other business in front of us so we don't know how to write software that runs businesses quite yet and it may be some time before that happens and so we don't have doing single-player for us is a little bit more difficult but one thing we can do is you know that we're adding into our product is the ability to kind of see where you rank on the leaderboard without appearing or yourself if you like which is which gives you a sense of kind of where you stand but again it's you know not something you need to be public about the other thing I should mention there's a reason pioneer as mostly pseudonyms and not real names I mean at some point we need to know people's names because we need to know where to send the money but you can go through the entire experience making up a fake username no one will know who you are and that is in many ways to afford people the ability to really experiment and be themselves without having to put profile pictures everywhere and and and I think that again that allows you to compete against yourself without really worrying about the rest of the world so so you know I think both but I think you're right both modes exist and and and I think you know we're kind of working to serve both of them well now I preheat so much you being willing to talk about some of the things you're trying to change overcome and have dealt with because so many times we get to look up to people like you and it's almost like you were talking about have been so coached in what to say so it's just such a great perspective and I know we received a lot of questions just everyone with this uncertainty there want to know what's gonna change coming out of this and you did an amazing blog post which will have linked up about the world 2.0 and I'm wondering for you guys internally are you assessing things differently are there new opportunities you're looking at because everything's around coated well I think the right strategy for us is as much as my blog post actually try to be in the game of prediction the right strategy for pioneers to react it not to predict and so we're gonna follow you know engineers and and and founders you know to where other markets they think are interesting because you know I think once the spirit of human ingenuity manages to sink its teeth into a market something happens at some point and it's true things have shifted a little bit you know life is seemingly there's a little bit less activity and people building kind of next generation sass and a little bit more activity in people building kind of new social networks ways to stay connected at home that type of thing I think this beckons an interesting question which I tried to address in that post which I've been thinking about which is one like is Co vid 19 a thesis for investment or as a temporary and to if it's if the current way of life isn't a thesis or investment because it will change you know what things are permanent and what things are temporary just in terms of human behavior shifts and so to the first point I think the current lifestyle is temporary but I think the vaccine is very far away and so we can kind of view ourselves in social distancing purgatory for quite some time we're gonna be in between worlds and and that will be for a while you know my information on this changes daily you know the the time - a new vaccine trying to speak to different experts and understand you know is it going to be a year or five years but you know call me tomorrow but right now I'm sensing it'll be more like five years they don't all have the novel spike protein shape but you know let's not forget there are four other coronaviruses called the common cold that we don't have a vaccine for so this it's not as easy as it seems it's you know it's not like foul Chi is gonna dr. foutch is gonna just pull this up because Trump asked them to you know from from his dusty old cabinet where he's been hiding it so so in in this world you know what changes and what doesn't and I think the way to think of that is so there are things we can't do and if there's a if if not having them or if there's an if there's alternative to not having them then the behavior might permanently stick if not a new company will get created so I'll give you an example handshakes handshakes will go away because not doing handshakes is fine you know they're not a requirement for humans then it's not oxygen on the other side concerts won't be here for quite some time humans really like mass gatherings I mean look at what religions have you can go back thousands of years we've been doing this for quite some time it's not just a the invention of avicii and so as a result I think there'll be some really interesting software to be built around kind of mimicking that experience of of presence and you know the way it's gonna look is this I can tell you I mean this is the way this unfolds time and time again every time there's a new medium the first few examples of it are super superimpositions of the old media on the news so just like the first TV shows our cameras pointed at radio shows and the first mobile apps are you very much look like Web Apps you know and then someone builds in terms of TV shows Westworld and then someone who builds in terms of mobile apps uber so it takes quite some time as we go from kind of the world one point know to the world 2.0 to get there like the real technology out of it you know the first digital encyclopedias we're not Wikipedia it was Britannica on a CD and so I think you know we'll get things like online concerts over zoom but then I think there'll be some weird 2.0 that someone will create of that education than a good another great example school over zoom is going to be the horseless carriage it's not and and there's gonna be something else I don't know exactly what it'll be you know some element of a game and education all merged in one or I suspect video is not the dominant medium audio is not video something like that I think will get created because the alternative is just not as good so that's kind of my rough framework for thinking about this but we're quite reactionary at pioneer you know we'll follow whatever people build and and chase chase what other dreams people have helped them maybe catch those dreams yeah your so your mode of thinking makes me think of that quote it's something along the lines of adapt to the present as opposed to trying to predict the future and so it sounds like that's what that's what you guys are working on you mentioned some of the things that are just catching your attention or where you think things may be leading to and I'd love to know how do you think work and hiring changes during all of this yeah I think the simplest mental model for that is a separation of the strong from the weak so I think what happens is if you're a good company that has a durable business model I think you basically eat up the best talent of the small companies that go under so that's one way hiring changes a lot of companies will go under and the best talent will concentrate within the better companies this will be painful but actually not totally bad because let's not forget you often need a recession for super talent to concentrate and for real great outcomes to happen so PayPal was the combined might of Max Levchin Peter Thiel Elon Musk David Sachs Keith er boy Roelof Botha others Jeremy Stoppelman who is the founder of Yelp all of these people would have had their own companies in a boom market but in a bear market you know they all concentrate together and I believe it was XCOM and kaan finiti that merged to create PayPal so I think we'll see stuff like that um in terms of hiring you know in terms of how work changes you know there's there's one side of the story which people tell you you know humans are gonna snap back to offices and it's all going to go back to normal um even prior to having a vaccine there's the other side of it which is people will tell you remotes now here forever and I think the truth will be somewhere in the middle obviously I think companies will have proven to themselves those that those that can will have proven to themselves that they can stay productive remote and so the opportunity to work remote I think will go from being seen as a perk to being seen as an alternative but um you know but I think offices there's just too much goodness in the real world for us to give up on that entirely do you thin I think in particular just one final thought a lot of that goodness is serendipity and we don't know how to do that on the internet yet but maybe we will but there's a lot there's a lot of interestingness around serendipity of just being able to stumble into someone at the watercooler and have a conversation with them that you don't quite get in the structured you know zoom world I'm wondering then if this opens up more serendipity I guess my mode of thinking there is if a company's trying to hire someone they might now eliminate some of those additional costs in terms of flying people in and and they're more likely to hire someone who who wouldn't move to that city do you think that opens up at all yeah I mean I think that's right I think to two things will drive that one will be the fact that everyone is now fully experimented with remote work and then I think the other is you know the cooling winds of a recession will happen and so I think people will be more sensitive to cost gotcha one thing you're talking about is just now this talent coming and something that I admire about you is just your ability of the tech talent and I'm wondering when you're meeting we'll call it a founder what are your spidey senses going off when you come around someone who's incredibly talented or are there certain things that you just see continue to pop up over and over again you know it's funny this question in many ways has been one that has been in the back of my mind for decade and I think about it constantly and I've spoken to other Talent Assessors about it endlessly and you know one day maybe I if I'm brave enough I'll write a book about it because I think it's a very interesting topic and I I feel like I'm still learning in this area so I'm not quite ready for the capstone project of a book but here's the thing I mean having gone back and forth on psychometrics I've read every single paper there is on that stuff I haven't gone back and forth on you know the role of IQ and intellect ever read most papers on that material there's something that's not captured by any of these frameworks which i think is much more important which is kind of just the raw energy and vitality you get from someone and I think I'd much rather take a bet on someone who had who will be able to play a thousand chess games then take a bet on someone who seems like they have merely the energy to play one and but you know statistically maybe they have high odds of winning that one game the reason is there's so much randomness in what is required to to kind of become successful the game has many more layers of dimensionality than than chess does you really want someone who's just going to have the energy to take multiple shots on goal until they succeed and and that's the big thing to focus on if like the world there's a simulation game you want someone who you can say no matter what they do no matter what the initial parameters are if you ran the simulation ten thousand times they'll probably come up just constantly giving it a shot and you know on their feet you know a relatively high percentage of the times um I think that is the big thing to look for you know Paul Graham talks about being looking Fifi wanting to feel intimidated while he's in the room with the other founder that being the emotion he seeks I think that that's kind of related to this form of energy if the person is dynamic if the person is driven if the person believes then then I think they become very interesting and I think that matters more than where I intellect and I think that matters more than any particular psychometric attribute so I would say you know mostly that's that's what's on my mind and I'm surprised I'm surprised because what I'm talking about seems pretty plain and it seems like a lot or if all people should have it but it's certainly not the case and I think even at an early level you can look at someone who's not even certain about what they're working on but if they have the energy they will succeed you've got me really intrigued now by a problem that you haven't solved yet and I almost view this as a creative type process for you trying to uncover that and I'm just really intrigued about your overall creative process it's something I've never heard you talk about before so so when you have a new idea like that you can even just call it something you you want to do a blog post around what's your creative process like it seems like you may do multiple thought experiments and run scenarios through your head yeah I mean the interesting thing I've been thinking about with with all of this is um when you want to start writing something down I find that I think this is true for many people the idea jumbles around in my head like a rock tumbler refining or finding or finding we're finding until I start writing it down and then once I started writing it down there's like a pressure release it's like a like a pressure cooker that has you know is letting off steam and it and it tumbles around my head a little bit less so there's a little bit of a counterintuitive crazy idea that works well for me and I've had I've spoken to people that have the opposite strategy but mine is to let it jumbled around in my head until I'm kind of I feel like I'm ready and then I I'm then once I ride I usually write it you know once fairly quickly and kind of get it out the door and I while the topic is kind of germinating or hopefully we're finding I'll definitely talk about it with other people and and think about it but I find you know I don't exactly know what it is but at some point I think my mind feel like the task has been done if I start writing and and the idea has kind of left my mind so I'm you know I I'm realizing this as I tell you my creative process is a quite chaotic in that sense that I will let something just jumbled around endlessly look the idea jumbled around endlessly until until I feel like it's gotten to a point where it's worthwhile yeah that rumination process is always one that intrigues me I'm wondering though when when something's been germinating in your head and you decide to take next steps how do you decide on it's something that's going to be worth the next steps for you I don't really and I never know I never know you know it's a this is kind of what I'm trying to convey to people at scale but I never really know I'm an I'm often surprised didn't even the surface area of just writing posts on the Internet I'm a very bad predictor in which post will be popular and it's certainly not correlated to the time I spend on it you know sometimes people really seem to enjoy something that took me 20 minutes to write and no one seems to care about the thing that I spent hours thinking about and so as a result I I don't overthink it too much and I think I write up a lot of things in it where in hindsight of course as I've read them the my dynamic is just wondering why even bother publishing such a terrible idea but I think that's just my own psyche but I think it's important not not to really overthink it and to try to get out there there is this psychometric property of industriousness people talk about um which is not you know really an assessment on say the quality or the how would you say that the finesse of anyone's worked but just their raw output and you know someone high-end industriousness will just have raw hi we're all output they'll just be producing a lot often not even aware of why or how or how much they're producing they're just doing it kind of on autopilot and that I think that's an interesting thing to shoot for because again I think you know whether it's a company a blog post you know a piece of music I don't know that you know when it's so small whether it's gonna be good or not so you know III do think it's useful to UM to kind of just get something out there and then try to get feedback and then you know or show it to customers in many ways or earlier rather than later and and the process of showing it to customers is not always pleasant but but that's fine it kind of makes you better it's not always pleasant of course because then you know when you worry in the back of your mind that you know they're not gonna love it so I understand you know the quote great artists ship its it it takes a certain element of fearlessness to do that putting yourself out there is never easy you're talking about all these things that you might not necessarily know the answer to I'm hoping you might have an answer to this one just in what area of your life do you think you have the best taste for you know that's a fun question I think I have a pretty good well I can tell you it's certainly not in in wine or fashion but I have a think I have a pretty good taste for you kind of general markets um and I don't think it's it's that much of an achievement it's just you look at stuff enough you kind of develop a sense for it and beckons of course an interesting question which is this great taste to often mean that you're the worst person to talk to about a certain topic because you know taste in many ways is just kind of pattern recognition and so I think I can patent recognize a great market in a bad market but the world is so volatile you know maybe for example I'll miss the next great healthcare company because that's just generally a bad market it's kind of an interesting question whether well what is the correct amount of taste and and and maybe there areas where you have kind of too much taste in because there's a bit of an explore exploit thing going on I think where you collect more information about a certain field and then you become trapped I mean this happens to machine learning algorithms all the time you become trapped in kind of a local maximum and and you miss the fact that you know had you've been a little bit more explorative you know two spaces to your left has a much higher hill or peak so I think it's a very interesting question to think about maybe over the weekend it wouldn't spend too many hours is the cyclic through this on a Thursday but um as to as to what the correct amount of taste is but it's it's clear to me that the the kind of dose response curve there is kind of an inverse U shape where you want some amount of it but not all of it I love how you reframe that now you have me thinking through this differently because when I ask the question of Moe's intrigue next about is do you work in that area and then kind of like why or why not so I like how you reach if did that for me what about just in terms of you you've been around a lot of people youyou've self-assess a lot what are most people just not paying attention to what are they did you think they would just dramatically increase their overall success in life and life happiness and define that how you may I think people are not I mean I found myself I think there's that so there's a strong desire now I think from the entire world to kind of get very much focused I don't know on on you know taking care of yourself and you know trying to be mindful and all that kind of stuff but I feel like that is you know grossly overrated in comparison to managing the inputs in your life you know the people you're surrounded by the food you eat the information that you read I think it's much easier to just try to optimize those things instead of trying to optimize what your brain does with everything you throw at it if that makes sense like I think if you have bad voltage you know in your in terms of what you plug yourself into I think you'll have you know spiky output you know you don't want to try to assume that you're gonna have a you know transformer in your body so feel like that's a pretty large underrated thing and of course beckons the question where like you know how do you change those inputs if you don't really have control over them if you're kind of just stuck somewhere the good news is the Internet is this vast equalizing landscape I mean it's really incredible when you think about it my internet is the same as a billionaire's internet which is the same as the Internet of someone in India right now for the most part pretty identical sure maybe slightly faster upload speeds whatever but for the most part it's the same and that's really beautiful that means you can kind of get in touch with anyone find a community for yourself and I think that's the that's a that's a very big thing to pay attention to you know we we are the average of the people we spend time with and you want to figure out ways to spend time with great people to increase your average so I think it's a pretty big thing I think I mean yeah I mean I think this the whole debate on I'm kind of in my I mean this is a little bit controversial but the whole mental health debate I think pales in comparison to say the debate around proper sleep and I often wonder how many hours have had space or meditation you accomplish in literally an hour of REM sleep and I think a lot of people early on in life have a strong desire to perform through output that is to say they want to be seen as cycling the bicycle as aggressively as possible but the world really doesn't care sorry about input the world really doesn't care about you know how much effort you put in the world really cares about how much output you have and you and you want to be working hard and smart you know not just hard yeah so I've got a question around that and so I'm really curious then how you spend the majority of your time and what are you using as barometer for your return on that invested time that's a good question I spend the majority of my time working and interfacing with you know pioneers founders people you know early-stage companies working on pioneer itself of course just trying to figure out what to improve what to fix we just launched this new thing called frontier she's kind of like a an interesting directory of cool projects kind of built online that kind of takes the shape of a subreddit so you know thinking about that working through that how to how to make it grow how to make it popular how to also make sure that it you know has a kind of a good community driving behind it it's something at the top of mind for me and you know the way I view the return on time there is it's pretty I mean it's pretty chaotic in the sense that we have metrics we look at first say the company of pioneer you know the people were funding the quality of the people were funding our other people funding the people that were funding that type of thing they're kind of obvious stuff you would be looking at I think if if you were in the organization you know and and and for me personally so much of my personal you know kind of personal on social capital is equities din that thing I spend a lot of time Dave I mean if that were successful I would be happily successful but I think the other thing that's important is you know even yeah outside of the main game you know just being helpful to close friends being helpful to family other people perceiving you as useful I think is the is the main thing I'd like and I feel like I often need maybe it's a flaw of mine to be dependent on and so you know I for me being able to produce something that other people find worthwhile that other people find useful you know be that an email a piece of software anything really that for me is joy well to be honest you're certainly checking the box there for me you've been incredibly helpful over the last year with your with your writing conversations just overall lessons learned so thanks for that I know you've got a lot going on today so I just I want to want to finish up with with two quick ones here and if we're just gonna be sitting down having this conversation in three years from now what do you need to have have happened that you just feel overall happy with the progress pioneer in yourself yeah I mean success for us in success for me for for pioneer is to be we want to be equity holders in hundreds of great businesses that are obviously valued as great themselves you know I think if the aggregate market cap of a pioneer companies was a hundred billion dollars we've consider ourselves certainly on the path to success and like I said I think the world could stand to have significantly more small companies you know in trade of you know four or five large tech giants and so if we could help increase the amount of variety the amount of kind of novelty in the world that way I think we'd be hugely successful so that's the trick for us you know it's it's not about having a billion users pioneers is not a really a tool for the masses it's a tool for the elite for the top one percent they don't even realize they're the one percent this isn't you know that the net worth one percent this is kind of the weird one percent the outsiders the top one percent Outsiders if we can find a way to find those limited number of people and to be clear I think there are millions of them but again not billions and get be at the ground floor as they start their business and propel them into success you know I think III think we feel pretty happy with our tombstone so that's the main thing we're shooting for is kind of being equity holders in hundreds of successful businesses doing a you know a whole eclectic mix of things Daniel I love it it's inspiring it's truly great work that you guys are helping so many people across the globe so final one here I'm always intrigued about what's coming through your your brain in terms of what you're reading and then who you just favorite thinkers of all time are I know you've mentioned Churchill a few times in this conversation we just love to get most updated new books or things that you've enjoyed reading and then who you just admire as a thinker sure yeah I mean there is actually a nutritional book that came out this year so that that's been an enjoyable one to read there's a really great book I only would recommend it to someone who runs it's an old book but it's a really great book possibly the greatest training book of all time let's see if I can pull up the name here you know it's funny a byproduct of reading on Kindle is I'm most familiar with the title of things III's that question someone asked me that last night and I couldn't remember probably five the last ten based on that so the book is called once a runner and it's really good if you're into running if you're not you know a wedding of the waters was a book that was recommended to me is about the construction of the Erie Canal I found that incredibly fascinating one that I'm just finishing now that I picked up recently is a book titled chaos as the Charles Manson book you know it's well it's if if you like the intellectual thrill of a conspiracy theory I think it's very interesting you know I don't know how knowledgeable or how informational it is just finishing Robert Caro's latest on Lyndon Johnson that's that's a kind of an endless song you start reading that and you never get it when a Strasse t yeah that's that's a bit of a capstone project maybe one final one I'd recommend I kind of really enjoyed was Copeland the secret history of the sacona quote secret history of Koch Industries I find that very interesting book paints a mixed picture and I think that's important I think it would have been very easy for the author to write the negative story but it's mixed positive and negative and yeah so so that was interesting maybe too I mean sorry you've now tripped me the man who solved the market I thought was super fascinating this is a book about Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies is a very interesting book about about the company and then maybe one final one is leadership and more andrew roberts book andrew roberts has written a tremendous amount of by he's about leaders during including Churchill this one is kind of how would you say snippets of areas of leadership you know from different leaders around the world so it's kind of a compressed way of reading his book some of the chapters are great some of the chapters are bad I'd encourage the reader to kind of leaf through it in non-sequential order from him we knew you know whatever they find most interesting it's funny you and I must be thinking through the same lens because those last three Copeland what did a deep dive on him reading Roberts right now and then Jim Simon's we had on the author Greg Zuckerman about a month or two ago but those first few I'd never heard of so I'm pumped to dive into those great awesome well Daniel this is always fun I always walk away from these conversations thinking differently for the listeners who are unfamiliar with you everything that's going on at pioneer we're gonna have it all linked up but anywhere else you want them checking out staying connected with you now that's great I mean my email is on my Twitter bio so you should feel free to email me and that's kind of it I mean people I think I think if if you feel like you shouldn't check out pioneer that is the exact type of person that should check out pioneer so give it a gander and or of course they're always very curious about the experience people go through not just learning about what they're working on so please send it any feedback you have our way yeah highly recommend you guys check it out it's fascinating and all of you Builders out there make sure you guys get on there and and and see if you can get some funding through pioneer but Daniel gross once again I can't thank you enough for joining us on what got you there thank you so much
